## Recent Sessions

### Session 232 — 2026-03-22 — Comprehensive Live QA Audit (24 Bugs, NO-GO Verdict)

**Worked on:** Full live browser QA audit of https://finda.sale across all roles (Nina/ADMIN, Oscar/PRO Organizer, Ian/Shopper) using Chrome MCP. Tested all major flows: homepage, login/logout, organizer dashboard, sale management, item management, messages, shopper favorites, admin, Stripe upgrade, follow system. Found 24 bugs total.

**Decisions:** ⛔ NO-GO verdict — 2 P0 blockers prevent beta launch. P0-1: messages thread page renders blank for all users (min-h-screen flex collapse in Layout). P0-2: Stripe checkout 404 (POST /api/billing/checkout returns HTML, not JSON). Both must be fixed before any organizer-facing beta recruitment. Dark mode billing section (BUG-15) identified as systemic hardcoded light-theme pattern — needs full dark: pass on billing pages. PWA install prompt loops on every navigation (BUG-24 — sessionStorage fix already shipped S225 but may need revisit).

**Token efficiency:** Chrome MCP browser-only session — zero subagent code dispatches. Efficient. Full audit scope with systematic role switching and console/network inspection.

**Token burn:** ~120k tokens (est., 2 compression events across prior + current context window).

**Next up:** Dispatch findasale-dev for P0 fixes (BUG-01 flex layout, BUG-02 checkout route, BUG-04 admin invites map). Then High + Medium bug queue. See recommended fix order in qa-audit-2026-03-22.md.

**Blockers:** All 24 bugs in audit report unfixed. Patrick manual push from S231 still pending. Prisma actions still pending Patrick.

**Files changed:** `claude_docs/operations/qa-audit-2026-03-22.md` (new), `claude_docs/STATE.md`, `claude_docs/logs/session-log.md`, `claude_docs/next-session-prompt.md` | Compressions: 2 | Subagents: findasale-records (wrap only) | Push method: Patrick PS1

### Session 231 — 2026-03-22 — Bug Queue Completion + AvatarDropdown (P0 UX Fix)

**Worked on:** (1) Verified BUG #22 live via Chrome MCP — Nina (ADMIN) now gets 200 from `GET /api/organizers/me`. (2) BUG #22 sweep: dispatched findasale-dev to fix all 54 inline `role !== 'ORGANIZER'` checks across 24 backend files (21 controllers + 3 routes). (3) Fixed BUG #30: `sales/[id].tsx` line 379 — `organizerId={sale.organizer.userId}` → `sale.organizer.id`. (4) Fixed BUG #31: `FavoriteButton.tsx` SVG fill via explicit props (Tailwind classes don't map to SVG attributes). (5) Fixed BUG #32: `favoriteController.ts` toggleItemFavorite now checks DB for existing record; verified bidirectional toggle live via Chrome API test. (6) Fixed BUG #33: `OnboardingModal.tsx` handleSkip writes localStorage synchronously before onComplete(). (7) Built `AvatarDropdown.tsx` (new component) — replaces 20+ inline desktop header auth links; wired into `Layout.tsx`. P0 UX fix per nav-dashboard-consolidation-2026-03-20 spec. (8) Layout.tsx: renamed Explore→Feed nav link; mobile Pro Tools section uses TierGatedNavLink. (9) Sale page: "Back to home" label, dark mode additions.

**Decisions:** AvatarDropdown shows initials-only (no profile photo field on User model yet). `user.organizerTier` is a tier string, not an image URL — avatar rendering logic corrected. Mobile drawer untouched per spec. BUG #22 sweep scope was larger than STATE.md stated (54 occurrences vs 15 estimated).

**Token efficiency:** Chrome MCP verification before dispatch (confirmed live bugs, not just code audit). 2 dev subagent dispatches. 1 MCP push (AvatarDropdown + Layout together, under 25k token limit). Larger BUG #22 sweep (24 files) handled by subagent, handed to Patrick for manual push.

**Token burn:** ~95k tokens (est.), 1 compression event (started from prior session summary).

**Next up:** Features #106–#109 (rate limit burst, DB pooling, API timeout guards, graceful degradation). After Patrick completes Prisma actions + missing Railway env vars.

**Blockers:** Patrick manual push required (sales/[id].tsx + 24 BUG #22 sweep files). Neon Prisma actions still pending Patrick. Railway env vars missing.

**Files changed (MCP pushed):** `packages/frontend/components/AvatarDropdown.tsx` (new), `packages/frontend/components/Layout.tsx`, `packages/frontend/components/FavoriteButton.tsx`, `packages/frontend/components/OnboardingModal.tsx`, `packages/backend/src/controllers/favoriteController.ts` | **Files pending Patrick push:** `packages/frontend/pages/sales/[id].tsx`, 24 backend BUG #22 sweep files (21 controllers + 3 routes) | Compressions: 1 | Subagents: findasale-dev (×2), findasale-records (wrap) | Push method: MCP (2 calls) + Patrick PS1 pending

### Session 230 — 2026-03-21 — S227 QA Audit Completion + BUG #22 Backend Fix

**Worked on:** (1) Completed deep functional QA audit across 4 roles (Ian/Shopper, Nina/ADMIN, Oscar/PRO, Quincy/TEAMS) using Chrome MCP browser automation with XHR/fetch interception. Tested cross-role round-trips: messaging ✅, Buy Now ✅, favorites (broken), Follow (broken). (2) Confirmed BUG #22 backend: Nina's JWT has `role: "ADMIN"`, not `"ORGANIZER"`. Direct API call `GET /api/organizers/me` → 403. UI shows "Unable to load sales" + infinite onboarding loop. (3) Confirmed BUG #30: Follow button fires 0 network requests — endpoint exists and is correct, bug is in frontend onClick handler. (4) Wrote full audit report to `claude_docs/audits/s227-qa-audit.md`. (5) Fixed BUG #22 backend: added `requireOrganizer` export to `auth.ts` (checks both `roles?.includes('ORGANIZER')` and `role === 'ORGANIZER'`); updated 5 inline guards in `organizers.ts`.

**Decisions:** BUG #22 backend fix scoped to `organizers.ts` (5 confirmed broken routes). 15 other files with same pattern flagged for follow-up sweep. BUG #30 root cause is frontend — `POST /:id/follow` endpoint confirmed correct in backend.

**Token efficiency:** QA audit used Chrome MCP browser automation (no code subagent). Fix inline (2 files, <20 lines total). Efficient session. Started from prior compressed context.

**Token burn:** ~85k tokens (est.), 1 compression (context limit hit in prior session — resumed from summary).

**Next up:** Verify BUG #22 fix live (Nina can now load sales). Dispatch BUG #30 (frontend Follow handler), BUG #31/#32 (favorites visual + toggle logic), BUG #33 (onboarding persistence). 15-file `role !== 'ORGANIZER'` sweep. Run Prisma actions (still blocking #73/#74/#75). Then #106–#109 pre-beta safety batch.

**Blockers:** Neon Prisma actions still pending Patrick. BUG #22 backend fix not yet pushed/verified live.

**Files changed:** `packages/backend/src/middleware/auth.ts` (requireOrganizer added), `packages/backend/src/routes/organizers.ts` (5 role checks fixed), `claude_docs/audits/s227-qa-audit.md` (new), `claude_docs/STATE.md`, `claude_docs/logs/session-log.md`, `claude_docs/next-session-prompt.md` | Compressions: 1 (prior session) | Subagents: findasale-dev (BUG #22 fix), findasale-records (wrap) | Push method: Patrick PS1

### Session 229 — 2026-03-21 — Railway/Vercel Build Repair + Frontend QA Audit + #75 Lapse Banner Fix

**Worked on:** (1) Railway build failures: stripeController.ts — 3x `findUnique`→`findFirst` for non-`@unique` `stripeCustomerId` field, null guard on `invoice.customer`, typed catch `(err: unknown)`. (2) Vercel build failure: `useNotifications.ts` named import → default import for `api`. (3) Full frontend QA audit — TypeScript clean. 2 BLOCKERs found: (a) #75 lapse banner dead — `tierLapsedAt` is on `UserRoleSubscription`, not `Organizer`; banner always invisible. (b) Lapse banner CTA → `/organizer/billing` (page doesn't exist). 4 WARNs: dead hook, polling without auth guard, `window.location.href` for internal nav, dead code branch in register.tsx. (4) All BLOCKERs + WARNs fixed: switched banner condition to `subscriptionStatus === 'canceled'` (valid Organizer field), added `subscriptionStatus` to all 3 JWT sign blocks + AuthContext, changed CTA to `/organizer/subscription`, deleted dead `useNotifications.ts` hook, fixed `notifications.tsx` nav to `router.push`/`window.open`. Required 3 push rounds due to wrong-model discovery mid-session.

**Decisions:** `tierLapsedAt` cannot go in JWT — it's on `UserRoleSubscription` not `Organizer`. `subscriptionStatus: 'canceled'` is the correct signal for the lapse banner. Dead hook deleted (no callers; notifications.tsx has own implementation).

**Token efficiency:** All inline edits (each <20 lines, 1-2 files). QA audit via findasale-qa subagent. Medium burn from 3 build-repair cycles.

**Token burn:** ~90k tokens (est.), 0 compressions.

**Next up:** Verify Railway + Vercel build green on latest commit. Run `prisma migrate deploy + prisma generate` against Neon (still pending — blocks #73/#74/#75 runtime). Then features #106–#109 (pre-beta safety batch).

**Blockers:** Neon Prisma actions still pending Patrick.

**Files changed:** `packages/backend/src/controllers/stripeController.ts`, `packages/backend/src/controllers/authController.ts`, `packages/frontend/hooks/useNotifications.ts` (deleted), `packages/frontend/components/AuthContext.tsx`, `packages/frontend/pages/notifications.tsx`, `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/dashboard.tsx`, `claude_docs/STATE.md`, `claude_docs/logs/session-log.md`, `claude_docs/next-session-prompt.md` | Compressions: 0 | Subagents: 1 (findasale-qa) | Push method: Patrick PS1 (3 commits)

### Session 227 — 2026-03-21 — Workflow Cleanup Sprint (Phase 2+3): Friction Audit Action Loop, Skill Archival, CLAUDE.md v5.0 Finalization

**Worked on:** (1) Phase 2a: Updated `daily-friction-audit` scheduled task with auto-dispatch action loop — HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW findings now auto-dispatch to findasale-records or findasale-dev; 3+ consecutive appearances triggers `## Patrick Direct` block; cosmetic items may defer 1-2 days. (2) Phase 2b: Changed `context-freshness-check` from daily to weekly Monday 8am (cron: `0 8 * * 1`). (3) Phase 2c: QA audit on /pricing page — 2 WARN findings: unauthenticated "Upgrade" button text (should be "Sign up for PRO/TEAMS"), no `?upgrade=success/cancelled` handling on dashboard return from Stripe. (4) Phase 3a: Deleted `.checkpoint-manifest.json` and `MESSAGE_BOARD.json`. (5) Phase 3b: Archived `context-maintenance` and `findasale-push-coordinator` skills — source SKILL.md files updated with ARCHIVED frontmatter + redirect notices; .skill packages built and presented to Patrick. (6) Phase 3c: CORE.md fully retired — CLAUDE.md v5.0 is now the single authority; all references updated. (7) Resolved CLAUDE.md 3-region merge conflict — kept v5.0 §§7-12 from remote, Behavior rules line from HEAD, both MCP limits sections. (8) Railway Dockerfile cache-bust pushed via MCP — forces fresh Docker build to unblock Stripe checkout 404.

**Decisions:** CORE.md retired (S226 merge + S227 finalization). context-maintenance + findasale-push-coordinator skills archived — findasale-records owns session wrap, CLAUDE.md §5+§11 own push rules. Stripe 404 root cause: stale Railway Docker layer (route existed in code, not a code bug).

**Token efficiency:** No subagent code dispatches — all doc/config work. 1 QA audit subagent. Low-medium burn. 1 compression event (context exhausted → continued in new session).

**Token burn:** ~90k tokens (est.), 1 compression.

**Next up:** Verify Railway rebuilt + Stripe checkout 404 resolved. Fix 2 /pricing WARN findings (findasale-dev dispatch). Continue product roadmap.

**Blockers:** Railway rebuild in progress (Dockerfile cache-bust commit 57fabb05 pushed ~22:44 UTC). Stripe checkout verification pending Railway completion.

**Files changed:** `packages/backend/Dockerfile.production` (S227 cache-bust — MCP push), `CLAUDE.md` (v5.0 finalized, merge conflict resolved — MCP push), `claude_docs/skills-package/context-maintenance/SKILL.md` (archived), `claude_docs/skills-package/findasale-push-coordinator/SKILL.md` (archived), `claude_docs/skills-package/findasale-records/SKILL.md` (wrap steps + scheduled tasks list updated), `claude_docs/logs/session-log.md`, `claude_docs/next-session-prompt.md`, `claude_docs/STATE.md` | Compressions: 1 | Subagents: 1 (findasale-qa for /pricing audit) | Push method: MCP (2 files) + Patrick PS1 (wrap files)
