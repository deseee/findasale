## Current Work

**S491 (2026-04-16) — Admin reports bug + security audit + eBay quota + orphaned pages + batch fixes**

- **Admin reports "No organizers found" root cause fixed ✅:** Frontend interface declared `organizers` key but backend returns `{ items, pagination }`. Line 78 `res.data.organizers ?? []` always returned `[]`. Fixed to `res.data.items ?? []` + `res.data.pagination?.total`. Also fixed `OrganizerResponse` interface.
- **eBay push quota wired ✅:** `ebayPushesThisMonth Int @default(0)` + `ebayPushesResetAt DateTime?` added to Organizer. Migration `20260416_ebay_push_quota` created. Quota check + monthly reset wired in `ebayController.ts`. Limits: SIMPLE=10, PRO=200, TEAMS/ENT=unlimited. Migration pending Patrick run.
- **CRITICAL: XP monthly caps now enforced ✅:** `checkMonthlyXpCap()` return value was being ignored — caps were advisory only. Now enforced silently. Fixed in `itemController.ts`, `treasureHuntQRController.ts`, `auctionJob.ts`.
- **CRITICAL: Referral rewards now atomic ✅:** `processReferral()` inside `prisma.$transaction()` in `authController.ts`. Prevents race-condition duplicate XP awards.
- **HIGH: Grace period blocks PRO/TEAMS features ✅:** `requireTier.ts` returns 403 `GRACE_PERIOD_RESTRICTION` for 7-day downgrade window.
- **HIGH: FraudSuspect flag on payment dedup ✅:** `stripeController.ts` — duplicate card fingerprint sets `User.fraudSuspect = true`.
- **Orphaned pages wired (batch 1+2) ✅:** SearchSuggestions (search page), FAQ (condition content added), BoostBadge (SaleCard + ItemCard), LiveFeedWidget (command-center), QuickReplyPicker (messages/[id]), DowngradePreviewModal (subscription), RankLevelingHint (ranks), RankUpModal (loyalty), ShopperReferralCard (profile), storefront/[slug] page rebuilt, hall-of-fame page fixed (raw fetch→api.get), hall-of-fame redirect added to next.config.js. Search link added to Layout.tsx Explore nav.
- **Backend gap fixes ✅:** Boost data included in listSales + getItemsBySaleId API responses. `rankIncreased: boolean` added to xpService.ts return type + propagated to all XP-awarding controllers. `rankIncreased`/`newRank` added to QR scan response.
- **Layout.tsx cleanup ✅:** My Collections → My Wishlist (title attribute line 727). Two-tone Montserrat logo (desktop + mobile, S490).
- **Pricing redirect loop fixed ✅:** `/pricing` was → `/organizer/pricing` was → `/pricing` (loop). Both now redirect to canonical `/organizer/subscription`. `/organizer/pricing.tsx` and `/pricing.tsx` both converted to permanent server-side redirects.
- **Deprecated stubs ✅:** `OrganizerHoldsPanel.tsx` stubbed (inferior to `/organizer/holds` page). `organizer/premium.tsx` stubbed (superseded by `/organizer/subscription`). `QuickActionsBar.tsx` stubbed (all links were `/organizer/dashboard` placeholders).
- **SharePromoteModal P0 fixed ✅:** 3 hardcoded "estate sale" instances in share templates replaced with dynamic `saleTypeLabel`. subscription.tsx brand drift fixed (4 occurrences "estate sale or auction" → inclusive). organizers/[id].tsx 4 dark mode violations fixed.
- **H-001 fixed ✅:** SearchFilterPanel.tsx — all filter section labels + radio labels now have `dark:text-gray-200`. Were invisible white-on-white in dark mode.
- **H-002 fixed ✅:** sales/[id].tsx — sections reordered to match D-006. Items is now first full-width section (position 5), before Reviews and Location.
- **H-003 fixed ✅:** subscription.tsx — "5 team members" → "Up to 12 team members" (D-007 locked at 12).
- **React Hooks violations fixed ✅:** add-items/[saleId].tsx — 3 useMutation + 1 useEffect moved above all conditional early returns. Rules of Hooks compliant.
- **Scout Reveal persistence verified + hardened ✅:** `scoutReveals` IS a `String[]` field on UGCPhoto — DB-persisted, no reset on restart. Fixed: null pointer exception (findFirst→findMany + null check), guard scope mismatch (was checking one photo but updating all — changed to `findMany` + `.some()` guard).

**S490 (2026-04-16) — Video + landing page polish + two-tone Montserrat logo**

- **organizer-video-ad.html polished (11 rounds) ✅:** White checkmarks on all 4 green-circle elements (Published scene + payment scene). Font sizes bumped (success-sub 14→18px, counter-text 15→17px, items-row 15→18px). Scene nav added: prev/next arrows + dot indicators (5 scenes). Wrapper height fixed after nav added (iframe 844→915px, desktop wrapper 693→750px, mobile 628→679px). Lamp SVG redesigned — empire style (narrow-top 18px, wide-bottom 52px, finial + collar + two-tier base) replacing martini-glass shape. Return beam delays corrected for right→left flow (0s/0.2s/0.4s with row-reverse). eBay push button color matched to amber-600 (#D97706). Scene 2 headline "You're done." on own line in orange; "Under an hour." nowrap on own line. Scene 3: "Shoppers Pay" / "on their phone." split. Beam + item labels brightened to rgba(255,255,255,0.60). s3 bullet timing fixed (moved to at:20600, before charge event at:22500 — were firing simultaneously due to array ordering). CTA copy: "Snap your first photo and watch it work."
- **video.html (landing page) polished ✅:** Page top padding 40→16px, logo-bar padding reduced. Mobile page padding reduced. Features list updated ("Advanced Analytics"). Per-sale offer copy: "Run just a few large sales a year? Get PRO capacity for $9.99 per sale." Badge: "No credit card. No trial.<br>No catch."
- **Two-tone Montserrat logo in app nav ✅:** Layout.tsx updated in 2 spots (desktop nav line 660, mobile drawer line 844). `Find<span text-amber-600>A.</span>Sale` with inline Montserrat 800 style. Montserrat added to _document.tsx Google Fonts URL (was not loaded before).

**S490 Files changed (4):**
- `packages/frontend/public/organizer-video-ad.html` — 11 polish rounds
- `packages/frontend/public/video.html` — wrapper heights, padding, copy
- `packages/frontend/components/Layout.tsx` — two-tone Montserrat logo (desktop + mobile)
- `packages/frontend/pages/_document.tsx` — Montserrat added to Google Fonts URL

---

**S488 (2026-04-16) — Feature flags backend API + Chrome QA + migration audit**

- **Feature flags backend API (P1) ✅:** 4 CRUD handlers added to `adminController.ts` (getFeatureFlags, createFeatureFlag, updateFeatureFlag, deleteFeatureFlag). 4 routes added to `admin.ts`. Pushed commit `6168a477`, Railway auto-deployed.
- **Chrome QA — /admin/feature-flags ✅:** Flags list loads. Create flag → appears in list. Toggle enabled → updates. Delete → removed. Full CRUD verified with real data.
- **Chrome QA — /admin/reports ✅:** Vercel `dpl_84K1j5GkkfLS2wSrBJUd3btH2pUY` READY. Both Organizer Performance + Revenue tabs verified as Alice Johnson — no crash, no error banner.
- **Migration status audit (psycopg2 → Railway DB):** S469 EbayPolicyMapping ✅ (Apr 15 05:10 UTC), S464 ebayNeedsReview ✅ (Apr 15 00:49 UTC), 20260416_admin_tables ✅ (Apr 16 11:55 UTC). All pending migrations confirmed applied — nothing outstanding.
- **Stuck migrations (historical, not blocking):** `20260325_add_auction_closed`, `20260412000001_rename_staff_to_member` (×3 duplicates), `20260324_dual_role_phase2` — all NULL finished_at. Not blocking current work but worth a cleanup pass.
- **Memory updated:** `feedback_check_dont_ask.md` now includes migration verification via Railway DB psycopg2. Never ask Patrick — check directly.

**S488 Files changed (2 — already pushed):**
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/adminController.ts` — 4 feature flag CRUD handlers
- `packages/backend/src/routes/admin.ts` — 4 feature flag routes + imports

**S488 Extended — Migration audit + Feature #72 activation**

- **Stuck migration audit ✅:** 4 NULL `finished_at` records investigated. Root causes found for all. 3 failed records deleted (2 duplicate `rename_staff_to_member` attempts), 2 marked applied (`dual_role_phase2`, `add_auction_closed`). Migration history is clean — 0 NULL records remain.
- **Schema state verified:** `auctionClosed` ✅ on Item, `notificationChannel` ✅ on Notification, `WorkspaceRole` enum has MEMBER (no STAFF) ✅, tables renamed to TeamMember/* ✅.
- **Feature #72 (UserRoleSubscription) activated ✅:** Backfill was never run — migration failed in March 2026 on `o."tierLapseWarning"` (column doesn't exist on Organizer). Table had 0 rows despite being wired into auth middleware, billing controller, POS tier controller, and tierLapseService. Ran backfill directly via psycopg2. **13 ORGANIZER rows inserted** — all organizers now have rows. Tier lapse tracking is now live. Both admin users covered (they're also organizers).
- **Shopper rows:** Not needed. Schema comment confirms "SHOPPER always active" — no tier/lapse tracking for shoppers by design.

---

**S486 (2026-04-16) — Video polish pass 2 + landing page strip + meta tags**

- **Video polished (organizer-video-ad.html) ✅:** Second full iteration pass on the 38s animated video.
  - Scene 2 camera lamp enlarged (`.lamp-svg-cam` 76→140px, `.cam-subject` 90→160px with amber frame).
  - Scene 2 review screen: added `height: 100%` + `box-sizing: border-box` so flex actually distributes, photo 130→190px, gap 10→14px, symmetric padding.
  - Scene 2 success screen: same `height: 100%` fix + symmetric padding 48/48, ring 96px, title 22px.
  - Scene 3 payments row: mini-phones 160px, beam min-width 44px, padding 4px — fits in 382px without squish.
  - Font bump across all 5 scenes: headlines +4–8px, bullets 16→20px, CTA logo 42→52px, CTA main 52→60px, CTA URL 18→24px, eBay push button 16→20px.
- **Landing page stripped (finda-sale-landing.html) ✅:** Removed hero H1+subtitle, 3 feature cards, testimonial, 3 FAQ rows, "Two sides. One app." eyebrow. Kept: logo, video, "Built for organizers. Loved by shoppers." + split, Free Forever offer, 2 FAQs, CTA, footer.
- **SEO meta tags added ✅:** Canonical URL, Open Graph (og:title/description/url/image/site_name), Twitter cards, theme-color (#D97706), keywords, author, robots, favicon/apple-touch-icon refs, JSON-LD SoftwareApplication structured data with Offer + Audience.

- **Pipeline wiring ✅:** Landing deployed at `finda.sale/video` via Next.js rewrite (`next.config.js` rewrites: `/video` → `/video.html`). Canonical + og:url + twitter:url + JSON-LD url all updated to `https://finda.sale/video`. Uses existing icon system (`/icons/favicon-32x32.png`, `/icons/apple-touch-icon.png`, `/favicon.ico`). Fixed pre-existing broken `og:image` refs in `trending.tsx` + `map.tsx` by adding `og-default.png` (1200×630).
- **Post-deploy fixes (Patrick reported blank iframe + width overflow) ✅:**
  - CSP `frame-src` in `next.config.js` line 203 was missing `'self'` — same-origin iframe was being blocked by CSP, leaving the phone frame empty. Added `'self'` so `/video` can embed `/organizer-video-ad.html`.
  - `.video-wrapper iframe` scale tightened: `0.821` → `0.82` (desktop: 390×0.82 = 319.8px cleanly fits 320px wrapper); mobile `0.744` → `0.7425` (390×0.7425 = 289.58px fits 290px wrapper).
- **File hygiene:** Canonical copies now live at `packages/frontend/public/video.html` + `packages/frontend/public/organizer-video-ad.html`. Repo-root copies should be removed to avoid edit-the-wrong-file trap.

**S486 Files changed (6):**
- `packages/frontend/public/video.html` (NEW — canonical landing; iframe scale fixed 0.821→0.82 desktop, 0.744→0.7425 mobile)
- `packages/frontend/public/organizer-video-ad.html` (NEW — 38s demo video embed)
- `packages/frontend/public/og-default.png` (NEW — 1200×630 social share image, fixes broken refs in trending/map)
- `packages/frontend/next.config.js` — `/video` → `/video.html` rewrite + CSP `frame-src 'self'` added (unblocks same-origin iframe)
- `claude_docs/STATE.md` — this wrap
- `claude_docs/patrick-dashboard.md` — this wrap

**S486 Files to delete (duplicates after move):**
- `finda-sale-landing.html` (root) — superseded by `public/video.html`
- `organizer-video-ad.html` (root) — superseded by `public/organizer-video-ad.html`

---

**S485 (2026-04-15) — Animated video iteration (organizer-video-ad.html)**

- **Video polished across 2 sessions (S485 + continuation) ✅:** Full iterative refinement of `organizer-video-ad.html`. Final state: 38-second 9:16 animated HTML5 video, 5 scenes.
- **Visual fixes:** Lamp larger in review card (90×112px), review photo area taller (130px), shutter moved lower (padding-bottom 30px), "Not anymore!" exclamation added, phones equal height (flex:1 on body), bullet font 16px, subline font 24px.
- **Layout fix:** Phone swap no longer shifts layout — CSS grid stacking (`.phone-states`) keeps both states in same grid cell, opacity transitions instead of display:none toggle.
- **Timing tuned:** Counter starts at 75 (not 0), 1.3s animation. Checkmarks fire as counter hits 100. Subline at 15900ms. Scene 3 starts at 19500ms (2.5s earlier than before). Bullets appear after shopper phone settles. Total DURATION 38s.
- **Copy fixes:** "Not anymore!" with !, `https://finda.sale` URL, eBay confirm sub-line removed, beam label "Paid" padded with en-spaces + min-width:48px so beam never shifts.
- **Grey text standardized:** All grey text rgba(255,255,255,0.60) matching CTA scene.

**S485 Files changed (1):**
- `organizer-video-ad.html` — polished 38s animated video (multiple rounds of timing/visual iteration)

---

**S491 continuation fixes:**
- **saleController.ts boost query fixed ✅:** `boosts` was used as a Prisma include on Sale — field doesn't exist on that model. Correct fix: batch query `BoostPurchase` by `targetId IN [saleIds]` after fetching sales, build a Map, merge into response. TS2353 error resolved. Railway build unblocked.
- **organizer/premium.tsx deleted ✅:** `export {};` stub broke Next.js build ("page without valid component"). Deleted via `git rm`.
- **shopper/lucky-roll.tsx deleted ✅:** Patrick confirmed delete (not redirect). Replaced by early-access-cache in S449 / D-XP-002.

---

**Next Session — S492:**

**Theme: Audit the audits — find blind spots in the agent/QA/preflight setup.**

Questions to investigate:
1. **Dev preflight gap:** The saleController boosts error passed the dev agent's TS check but failed Railway. How? The agent ran `tsc --noEmit` but the Prisma client wasn't regenerated in the VM — so `SaleInclude` didn't reflect actual schema relations. Fix: dev agents must run `npx prisma generate` before `tsc --noEmit` when their changes touch Prisma queries.
2. **QA gate effectiveness:** 20+ features from S491 are unverified. Is the Chrome QA backlog growing faster than it's being cleared? What's the actual verified-vs-shipped ratio over the last 10 sessions?
3. **Scheduled tasks:** Are the 3+ scheduled tasks actually running? When did they last fire? Check `mcp__scheduled-tasks__list_scheduled_tasks`.
4. **Skills drift:** Are findasale-* skill rules (schema gate, TS check gate, removal gate) actually being followed, or are agents skipping them under compression? Review the last 5 dev agent handoffs for gate compliance.
5. **Blind spots in setup:** What categories of errors keep recurring (Prisma relation assumptions, implicit-any, missing null checks)? Is there a pattern the preflight gates don't catch?
6. **Memory staleness:** Several project memory entries are from S225–S296. Which are stale or contradicted by current STATE.md?

**Patrick manual actions required:**
1. Run eBay migration: `cd packages/database && $env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:QvnUGsnsjujFVoeVyORLTusAovQkirAq@maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:13949/railway" && npx prisma migrate deploy && npx prisma generate`
2. Run full push block (below)
3. Stripe Connect webhook (P2 ongoing since S421): Stripe Dashboard → Connected account events → `payment_intent.succeeded` → `/api/webhooks/stripe` → Railway `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
4. Delete root files: `finda-sale-landing.html`, `organizer-video-ad.html`, `The_True_Plan.md`

**Pending Chrome QA (none browser-verified this session):**
Admin reports fix, LiveFeedWidget, QuickReplyPicker, SearchSuggestions, BoostBadge, DowngradePreviewModal, RankLevelingHint, RankUpModal, ShopperReferralCard, storefront page, hall-of-fame fix, pricing redirects (confirm no loop), SharePromoteModal, H-001 dark mode filters, H-002 section order, H-003 team cap copy, React Hooks violations, Scout Reveal fix.

**Next work:**
- S492 audit: dev preflight gap, QA backlog ratio, scheduled task health, skill gate compliance, recurring error patterns, memory staleness
- Weekly audit M-001/M-002/M-003/M-004 medium findings (shopper/history table clipping, etc.)
- DECISIONS.md entry needed: Wishlist is canonical name (confirmed by Patrick S491)
- Chrome QA pass on S491 batch (20+ items need verification)

**S484 (2026-04-15) — Organizer acquisition playbook + animated video brief**

- **Organizer Acquisition Playbook ✅:** Rebuilt twice this session. First pass wrong scope (cold outreach). Second pass correct: demand generation — organizers arrive pre-sold, sales conversation is just a trial offer. Covers community presence, before/after video asset, ringless voicemail (awareness touch not pitch), social proof flywheel, referral mechanics, probate attorney/consultant network. No "AI" language anywhere. Peer-to-peer tone throughout. Saved to `Organizer_Acquisition_Playbook.md` in repo root.
- **Animated video research ✅:** Tested Runway (paywall), Kling (1 free then paywall), Google Flow/Veo 3.1 (free — 50 credits/day, 20/generation, 9:16 supported). Settled on animated HTML5/React build instead of AI video — more brand-accurate, no watermark, no credits, free.
- **Video prompts written ✅:** 10 scene prompts for Veo 3.1 (Clip 1 iterated 4x based on feedback). Format locked: 25-second vertical 9:16 TikTok/Shorts, 3 AI clips + real screen recording. Structure: 0–5s chaos → 5–15s screen recording → 15–22s POS → 22–25s CTA.
- **Brand assets pulled ✅:** Colors, fonts, features extracted from tailwind.config.js + globals.css + finda.sale/organizer/pricing. Ready for next session animated build.

**S484 Brand Assets (for next session animated video):**
- Background: `#F9F7F4` (warm-100)
- Primary text: `#1A1A1A` (warm-900)
- Accent/CTA: `#D97706` (amber-600)
- Muted/secondary: `#8B7355` (warm-500)
- Success/sold: `#059669`
- Sage accent: `#6B9E7F`
- Dark mode bg: `#1C1C1E` / text: `#F5F5F0`
- Headings: Montserrat (globals.css) / Fraunces (tailwind config)
- Body: Inter

**S484 Pricing features to highlight (from finda.sale/organizer/pricing):**
- Photo-to-listing (auto-tag → publish) — all tiers, core demo moment
- QR codes + POS + social posts — all tiers
- Built-in payments (shopper pays on their phone)
- Virtual Queue — PRO+
- "Sell smarter." tagline
- CTA: "Try it free"

**S484 Guru Research — Acquisition Strategy Intelligence:**

**Gurus to study (prioritized):**
- Tier 1 (now): Alex Hormozi ($100M Leads — Core Four + Lead Getters + Grand Slam Offer/risk reversal), Nick Huber (Sweaty Startup — local-first, GMB, Nextdoor, physical presence)
- Tier 2 (30 days): Codie Sanchez (audience acquisition, media-first, tributaries), Noah Kagan (48hr validation, AppSumo launch), Russell Brunson (full funnel: RVM→video→trial→month-2 upsell)
- Tier 3 (90 days): Justin Welsh (founder as brand), Sam Parr/Shaan Puri (who already has my customers — EstateSales.NET has 50k organizers)
- Also study: Paul Yonover (Dream 100), Dan Henry (B2B SaaS cold email)

**Innovation ideas approved (from S484 agent dispatch):**
- Risk-reversal guarantee: "first 3 items free, don't move 2 in 30 days = refund month 1" — BUILD NOW (15 lines)
- Probate attorney referral loop with tracking links + profile badge — BUILD NOW (~150 lines)
- ProductHunt + AppSumo launch — BUILD NOW (no code, potential $4,900 immediate)
- Month-2 upsell email triggered by feature limit behavior — BUILD NOW (30 lines)
- EstateSales.NET partnership/migration offer — RESEARCH (ops + legal, not dev)
- 48-hour concierge sprint with 5 organizers → case study — BUILD NOW (no code)
- Copy reframe: "Save time" → "Finish. Then go on vacation." — A/B test NOW
- Estate Sale Insider podcast (bi-weekly, zero competition in this space) — BUILD NOW
- Justin Welsh 5-part TikTok screen recording series — BUILD NOW

**Influencer target list (S484):**
- Gary Vaynerchuk — "Trash Talk" garage sale series, 34M YT subs, explicitly loves yard/estate sales. Shopper-side pitch: "app to find sales near you." 
- Lara Spencer — HGTV Flea Market Flip + new "That Thrifting Show," massive TV audience
- Mike Wolfe — American Pickers, History Channel antiques audience
- Flea Market Flipper (Rob & Melissa Stephenson) — dedicated reseller community, teach flipping as business
- Hairy Tornado — full-time YouTube/Whatnot reseller
- Ralli Roots (Ryan & Alli) — $200 → 6-figure reselling income, garage sale hauls
- Treasure Hunting with Jebus — 727K YouTube subscribers
- Thrifting Vegas — specifically covers estate sales + garage sales for resale profit
- Whatnot platform — $6B+ GMV, estate/vintage category, integration + influencer partnership play

**Two-sided influencer strategy:** Shopper-side influencers (Gary Vee, Flea Market Flipper) drive BUYERS to browse FindA.Sale → organizers see traffic → organizers adopt. Same flywheel as Airbnb (travelers pull hosts).

**ICP (ideal first organizer):** Solo or 2-person team, 6-20 sales/year, currently using spreadsheets + phone photos + Venmo, tech-comfortable, frustrated by setup time. ASEL professional member profile. NOT: 1-sale/year hobbyist. NOT: national liquidation enterprise.

**S484 Files changed (2):**
- `Organizer_Acquisition_Playbook.md` (rebuilt v3 — Koerner/Outscraper methodology + guru framework summary + influencer flywheel + ICP section)
- `organizer-video-ad.html` (NEW — 25-second animated HTML5 marketing video, 9:16 vertical, 5 scenes, brand-accurate, self-contained)

**S483 (2026-04-15) — eBay settings bugs + Admin dashboard rebuild + Cost protection docs + Organizer signals spec**

**S483 Part 1 — eBay settings page bugs (3 fixes + sticky bar):**
- **Bug A — oz input spinners ✅:** Weight tier oz inputs changed from `type="number"` to `type="text"` in settings/ebay.tsx (lines 398, 544). Removes browser spin buttons.
- **Bug B — Policy dropdown not persisting ✅:** Dropdown onChange refactored to atomic `setMapping` with inline policy lookup + `value={tier.policyId || ''}` controlled binding. Selection now sticks.
- **Bug C — "Use suggested defaults" range fix ✅:** `ebayPolicyParser.ts` line 83 changed from `(lb + 1) * 16` to `(lb + 1) * 16 - 1`. Now: 1+ lb → 16–31 oz, 2+ lb → 32–47 oz, 3+ lb → 48–63 oz, 4+ lb → 64–79 oz, 5+ lb → 80–95 oz, 6+ lb → 96+.
- **Bug D — Sticky save bar z-index:** Already `z-50` from S469. No change needed.

**S483 Part 2 — Admin dashboard rebuild (7 parallel agents):**
- **Admin dashboard index ✅:** Rebuilt `pages/admin/index.tsx` with 6-row KPI layout: Row 1 money KPIs (Today's Revenue, MRR, 30-day Transaction Revenue, Hunt Pass Revenue), Row 2 platform KPIs (Users, Organizers with tier breakdown, Sales, Items), Row 3 Conversion Funnel (Signups→Have Organizer→Created Sale→Published Sale→Paid Tier with % at each step), Row 4 sparklines (7-day signups/revenue/sales via inline div bars), Row 5+6 Quick Links + Recent Activity unchanged. Graceful fallbacks for undefined fields.
- **Admin reports page ✅:** Implemented `pages/admin/reports.tsx` from Coming Soon. Tab 1: Organizer Performance table (sortable by revenue/sales/sellThrough/lastActive, tier badges, sell-through color coding, CSV export). Tab 2: Revenue breakdown by period (7d/30d/90d) with summary cards + daily bar chart + detail table.
- **Admin items page ✅:** Implemented `pages/admin/items.tsx` from Coming Soon. Global item search (300ms debounce) + status filter. Results: photo thumbnail, title, price, status badge, organizer, sale, date. "View" → `/organizer/edit-item/[id]`. Pagination.
- **Admin broadcast page ✅:** Implemented `pages/admin/broadcast.tsx` from Coming Soon. Audience selector (ALL/ORGANIZERS/SHOPPERS/PRO_ORGANIZERS/TEAMS_ORGANIZERS) with live recipient count preview. Subject + body + character counter. Confirmation dialog before send. Success/error states.
- **Admin feature flags page ✅:** Implemented `pages/admin/feature-flags.tsx` from Coming Soon. Flags table with toggle (optimistic UI + rollback), tier restricted badge, last updated/by, inline new-flag form with key validation. Empty state shows suggested flags. NOTE: Requires FeatureFlag schema table (see below — schema pending).
- **Backend admin controller ✅:** Upgraded `adminController.ts` `getStats` to return tierBreakdown, mrr, mrrByTier, transactionRevenueLast30d/Today, huntPassRevenueLast30d, aLaCarteRevenueLast30d, conversion funnel, 7-day sparklines. Added `getAdminItems`. Added `ebayRateLimit` status to stats response.
- **Backend reports controller ✅:** New `adminReportsController.ts` — `getOrganizerPerformance` (paginated, sortable), `getRevenueReport` (breakdown by 7d/30d/90d).
- **Backend broadcast controller ✅:** New `adminBroadcastController.ts` — `sendBroadcast` (Resend, audience-filtered), `getRecipientsPreview`.
- **eBay rate limiter ✅:** New `packages/backend/src/lib/ebayRateLimiter.ts` — in-memory daily counter (same pattern as aiCostTracker.ts), default soft cap 4,500/day (env `EBAY_API_DAILY_LIMIT`), returns 429 + `code: EBAY_RATE_LIMITED` when limited. `ebayController.ts` instrumented: rate limit gate at top of `pushSaleToEbay()`, `trackEbayCall()` after successful API calls in push + policy fetch + merchant location.
- **Routes updated ✅:** `routes/admin.ts` — added GET /reports/organizers, GET /reports/revenue, POST /broadcast, GET /broadcast/preview, GET /items.

**S483 Part 3 — Cost protection & signals docs:**
- **Cost protection playbook ✅:** `claude_docs/operations/cost-protection-playbook.md` — 8 services (Cloudinary, Google Vision, Anthropic, Railway, Vercel, eBay API, Stripe, Resend) with risk ratings, exact URLs, step-by-step instructions, quick-action checklist, viral spike response plan.
- **Organizer signals spec ✅:** `claude_docs/strategy/organizer-signals-spec.md` — 4 proactive expansion signals (fee savings breakeven, capacity trajectory, feature gap, velocity acceleration) + full churn risk scoring (30% activity / 40% engagement / 30% business, seasonal override). Schema for OrganizerScore table included.

**S483 Architect schema designs (PENDING implementation — schema.prisma not yet updated):**
- **FeatureFlag:** id, key (unique), description, enabled, tierRestricted, updatedAt, updatedBy
- **PwaEvent:** id, eventType, userId?, sessionId?, createdAt (append-only)
- **OrganizerScore:** id, organizerId (unique), expansionScore, expansionTier, expansionTopSignal, churnScore, churnBand, churnTopSignal, scoredAt, createdAt, updatedAt
- **ApiUsageLog:** id, service, dateKey, callCount, estimatedCostCents, unique(service, dateKey)

These tables are required before: feature flags backend CRUD, PWA event tracking, OrganizerScore daily cron, persistent API cost tracking (replace in-memory counters).

**S482 (2026-04-15) — Camera UI overhaul: settings pill, toast fix, pinch zoom, fullscreen iPad**

**S482 What happened:**
- **Toast positioning fix ✅:** Standard toasts were `top-4 right-4` — inside the header zone. Changed to `top-14 md:top-20` to clear header on all screen sizes.
- **Camera settings panel built ✅:** Full collapsible settings system in RapidCapture.tsx:
  - X button always top-left (never covered)
  - Gear button top-right opens vertical pill dropping down from gear
  - Pill contains: Flash/Torch cycle (Off→On→Auto→Torch), White balance (sub-chips extend left), Timer (Off/2s/5s), Corner guides toggle, Level indicator toggle, Switch camera
  - Flash and torch combined into single button cycling Off→On→Auto→Torch (torch step skipped if unsupported)
  - Tap-outside backdrop closes pill
  - White balance sub-chips positioned as child of pill, extend left from WB button
- **Camera fullscreen on iPad ✅:** Changed `md:` breakpoints to `lg:` on outer container modal treatment — iPads (768px) now stay fullscreen.
- **Settings button z-index fix ✅:** Two bugs found and fixed:
  1. Viewfinder (`flex-1 relative overflow-hidden`) had no z-index, painting over top bar in DOM order → added `z-0`
  2. Settings panel had `z-19` (invalid Tailwind class, compiled to nothing) → changed to `z-30`
- **Level indicator fixed ✅:** Was a static line. Now reads `deviceorientation` gamma, rotates 80px bar, amber ≤±2°, white ±2–10°, red >±10°. iOS 13+ permission request. Cleanup on unmount.
- **Pinch-to-zoom fixed ✅:** Browser was claiming pinch gesture as page zoom. Added `touch-none` (touch-action: none) to viewfinder div.
- **Zoom pill added ✅:** Always-visible `0.5×/1×/2×/3×` pill centered at bottom corner bracket level (`bottom-6 left-1/2`). Only levels device supports are shown. Hidden if zoom not supported.
- **Hunt Pass modal + unlock flow:** Discussed but not dispatched — Patrick noted it fires too much, needs session-level throttle matching other modals.

**S482 Files changed (2):**
- `packages/frontend/components/RapidCapture.tsx` — full camera settings overhaul (multiple passes)
- `packages/frontend/components/ToastContext.tsx` — toast position top-4 → top-14 md:top-20

---

**S481 (2026-04-15) — AI camera improvements + trails security + Hubs nav move**

**S481 What happened:**
- **Trails security fix ✅:** `/shopper/trails` public endpoint exposed all trails (anyone could see/edit/delete). Fixed: new authenticated `GET /trails/mine` endpoint (trailController.ts `getMyTrails`) filtering by `userId`. Route registered BEFORE `/:trailId` to prevent Express route conflict. Frontend `useMyTrails` hook updated to `/trails/mine`. `[trailId].tsx` fetch updated to direct lookup. Edit/Delete buttons wrapped in `user?.id === trail.userId` ownership guard.
- **Hubs nav move ✅:** Market Hubs moved from general organizer section to TEAMS block in both AvatarDropdown.tsx and Layout.tsx. Icon color changed from `text-purple-400` to `text-gray-400` to match TEAMS section style.
- **AI camera improvements batch (7 items) ✅:** cloudAIService.ts + processRapidDraft.ts + review.tsx:
  - TEXT_DETECTION added to Vision API (catches brand marks on glass/dark items; combined with LABEL_DETECTION)
  - Sparse-label fallback: if <3 specific labels detected, Haiku instructed to reason from silhouette/shape
  - Anti-anchor pricing: removed "estate sale / 20–50% of retail" framing entirely; replaced with secondary market comp-grounded language + non-round example JSON (`{"low":7,"high":23,"suggested":14}`)
  - Comp-based price refinement in processRapidDraft: fetches 5 recent SOLD items by detected category → `suggestPrice` override; best-effort fallback
  - Improved conditionGrade visual checklist: scratches, chips, fading, rust, missing parts, repair signs
  - Tag grouping by type: suggested tags now rendered in Material/Era/Brand/Style/Other groups
  - Within-session tag suppression: tags removed ≥2 times hidden from suggestions for that session
  - Condition-adjusted pricing: selecting a condition grade silently calls `/items/ai/price-suggest` and updates price field; grades with disabled cursor while refreshing
- **TS fix:** processRapidDraft.ts comp map callback explicit type (was implicit `any`)

**S481 Files changed (9):**
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/trailController.ts` — added `getMyTrails` function
- `packages/backend/src/routes/trails.ts` — `GET /mine` route registered before `/:trailId`
- `packages/frontend/hooks/useTrails.ts` — `useMyTrails` → `/trails/mine`
- `packages/frontend/pages/shopper/trails/[trailId].tsx` — direct fetch + ownership guard on Edit/Delete
- `packages/frontend/components/AvatarDropdown.tsx` — Hubs moved to TEAMS block, grey icon
- `packages/frontend/components/Layout.tsx` — Hubs moved to TEAMS block (mobile nav), grey icon
- `packages/backend/src/services/cloudAIService.ts` — TEXT_DETECTION, sparse-label fallback, anti-anchor pricing, improved conditionGrade prompt, non-round example JSON
- `packages/backend/src/jobs/processRapidDraft.ts` — comp-based price refinement post-AI, TS explicit type
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/add-items/[saleId]/review.tsx` — tag grouping, within-session suppression, condition-adjusted pricing handler + grade button wiring

**S480 (2026-04-15) — S468 status card fix + photo lightbox + Item 5 verified + eBay toast fix**

**S480 What happened:**
- **S468 status card fix ✅:** `GET /api/ebay/connection` (ebayController.ts L1325–1338) now returns `fulfillmentPolicyId`, `returnPolicyId`, `paymentPolicyId`, `policiesFetchedAt`. Frontend condition (settings.tsx L851) changed from gating on all 3 policy ID fields to `ebayStatus?.policiesFetchedAt`. Business Policies card now shows green ✓ when policies have been synced.
- **Photo lightbox ✅:** `ItemPhotoManager.tsx` — added `lightboxUrl` state, Escape key handler, `cursor-zoom-in` + `onClick` on photo thumbnails, full-screen overlay with close button and stopPropagation. Patrick verified: "lightbox works."
- **Item 5 reconciliation ✅ (already done in S467):** STATE.md said "dispatch dev next session" — verified full implementation exists in ebayController.ts (L3687–3850: `syncEndedListingsForOrganizer` with GetMultipleItems batches of 20) and `ebayEndedListingsSyncCron.ts` (4h cron). No dispatch needed.
- **NudgeBar organizer suppression ✅:** `NudgeBar.tsx` already had `user?.role === 'ORGANIZER'` guard — confirmed rendering suppressed for organizers via Chrome (screenshot ss_2621nxuyu).
- **eBay save bar browser-confirmed ✅:** `/organizer/settings/ebay` sticky save bar confirmed rendering in actual browser via JS hot-pink injection (Patrick: "it's pink"). Screenshot tool has ~115px blind spot at viewport bottom due to browser chrome offset — bar exists and is functional despite being off-screen in tool captures.
- **eBay push error toast fix (P2) ✅:** `edit-item/[id].tsx` `onSuccess` handler was checking `result?.error` but backend sends `result.code` + `result.message` — `error` field never exists. Fixed to check `result?.code?.includes('NOT_CONNECTED')`, `result?.code?.includes('POLICIES')`, fallback to `result?.message`. Live push fired and confirmed `NO_FULFILLMENT_POLICY_MATCH` response correctly parsed.
- **USED grade-S → USED_EXCELLENT code-verified:** `mapGradeToInventoryCondition` (ebayController.ts L2493–2510) confirmed: grade S + condition=USED returns `USED_EXCELLENT`. Live verification UNVERIFIED (test item has weight=null, triggering `NO_FULFILLMENT_POLICY_MATCH` before condition logic runs).
- **S469 P2 bug noted:** Sticky "Save setup" bar visually hidden behind footer when scrolled to page bottom (z-index issue). Save still works. P2, not blocking.

**S480 Files changed (4):**
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/ebayController.ts` — added 4 policy fields to /api/ebay/connection response
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/settings.tsx` — changed Business Policies condition to `policiesFetchedAt`
- `packages/frontend/components/ItemPhotoManager.tsx` — lightbox implementation
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/edit-item/[id].tsx` — eBay push error toast: result.error → result.code/message

**S469 (2026-04-15) — eBay Phase 1-3 Foundation: Policy Mapping + Weight-Tier Routing + Draft Mode + Setup UI**

**S469 What happened:**
- Patrick flagged the push-first-policy approach as a shortcut. Real-world organizer (Patrick himself) has 22 shipping policies named by weight tier ("8oz Ground Advantage", "1+ lb Ground Advantage", "6+ lb Ground Advantage", "Freight 150+ lb Freight", etc.). eBay also supports 10 description templates per seller.
- Laid out 3-layer architecture: (1) EbayPolicyMapping model with default + weight-tier + shipping-class + category overrides, (2) merchant location routing (sale address / organizer address / existing eBay location), (3) description template injection + draft mode toggle.
- Dispatched three parallel agents (non-overlapping file ownership):
  - **Agent A** (schema + parser): New `EbayPolicyMapping` model, migration `20260415_ebay_policy_mapping`, `ebayPolicyParser.ts` utility (classifyPolicy, parseWeightTiers, matchWeightTier, toOunces). Weight-tier parser handles "8oz", "1+ lb", "N+ lb" — last "N+ lb" promoted to Infinity.
  - **Agent B** (backend): Added `fetchAllEbayPolicies`, `fetchEbayMerchantLocations`, `getEbaySetupData`, `saveEbayPolicyMapping`, `resolvePoliciesForItem`. Modified push flow to per-item routing with priority: category override → HEAVY_OVERSIZED → FRAGILE → weight tier → UNKNOWN → default → EbayConnection fallback. Description template `{{DESCRIPTION}}` placeholder injection. Draft mode wraps publishOffer call.
  - **Agent C** (frontend): New `/organizer/settings/ebay.tsx` (729 lines) — 8 sections: page shell, default policies, weight-tier matrix (editable with "Use suggested defaults"), shipping classification overrides, category overrides, description template, draft mode + merchant location radio, sticky save bar. Added "Advanced eBay Setup →" link in settings.tsx.
- All three agents returned zero TypeScript errors. Main session verified schema fields + new exports + route registration.
- Agent A flagged: pnpm workspace symlink issue prevented `prisma generate` in VM — Patrick must run manually after migrate deploy.

**S469 Files changed (7):**
- `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma` — added `EbayPolicyMapping` model + `ebayPolicyMapping` relation on Organizer
- `packages/database/prisma/migrations/20260415_ebay_policy_mapping/migration.sql` (NEW)
- `packages/backend/src/utils/ebayPolicyParser.ts` (NEW, 172 lines)
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/ebayController.ts` — policy routing, template injection, draft mode, new endpoints
- `packages/backend/src/routes/ebay.ts` — `GET /setup-data`, `POST /policy-mapping`
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/settings/ebay.tsx` (NEW, 729 lines)
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/settings.tsx` — "Advanced eBay Setup" link

**S469 Patrick manual actions REQUIRED (schema change):**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\desee\ClaudeProjects\FindaSale\packages\database
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:QvnUGsnsjujFVoeVyORLTusAovQkirAq@maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:13949/railway"

**S468 (2026-04-15) — eBay policy sync UI + /sync-policies route**

**S468 What happened:**
- Audited Patrick's Celestion listing showing "Free Standard Shipping" — confirmed the push flow was ALREADY correct: lines 1648–1650 of ebayController.ts use `conn.paymentPolicyId/fulfillmentPolicyId/returnPolicyId` from DB, with a hard validation gate at line 1392.
- Schema already had all policy fields: `paymentPolicyId`, `fulfillmentPolicyId`, `returnPolicyId`, `policiesFetchedAt`, `merchantLocationKey`. No migration needed.
- `fetchAndStoreEbayPolicies()` was already implemented — just needed `export` keyword added.
- Added `POST /api/ebay/sync-policies` route — authenticated organizer endpoint to manually re-fetch policies from eBay Account API.
- Added policy sync status UI to organizer settings page: green ✓ when all 3 policies synced, amber warning with eBay link when missing, "Sync from eBay" button.
- Both packages: zero TypeScript errors verified by main session.

**S468 Files changed (3):**
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/ebayController.ts` — added `export` to `fetchAndStoreEbayPolicies`
- `packages/backend/src/routes/ebay.ts` — added import + `POST /sync-policies` route
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/settings.tsx` — policy status card + sync button

---

**S467 (2026-04-15) — eBay listing quality batch (6-item queue) + sitewide organizer rarity filter fix**

**S467 What happened:**
- **P0 sitewide bug found & fixed:** All 7 organizer-facing pages called public `/items?saleId=` endpoint which runs Hunt Pass rarity filter. ULTRA_RARE/RARE items created within 6h were invisible to the organizer on their own management pages (Celestion $285, ULTRA_RARE, 1.8h old — disappeared). Fixed by switching all organizer management pages to `/items/drafts` (authenticated, no rarity filter). Public browsing and Buyer Preview remain unaffected.
- **S466 6-item queue completed:** Items 1–4 and 6 shipped. Item 5 (reconciliation) has Architect spec ready, dev dispatch next session.
- **Item 1** (category honor): No bug — current code already respects DB value.
- **Item 2** (condition → eBay enum): Grade S + condition=USED now sends USED_EXCELLENT not NEW.
- **Item 3** (aspect auto-fill): Brand checks item.brand first; MPN checks item.mpn; tags matched against enum. No more Brand="RIC" on speakers.
- **Item 4** (toast on success): Fixed 3 files — was checking `result.success` instead of `result.status === 'success'`.
- **Item 5** (reconciliation spec): Architect spec written — `claude_docs/specs/ebay-listing-reconciliation-spec.md`. Hybrid cron+on-demand. No schema changes needed. ~150 lines. Dispatch dev next session.
- **Item 6** (watermark QR): Resized 130→85px, moved g_south→g_south_east (bottom-right corner).
- **No migrations this session. No schema change.**

**S467 Files changed (19 + 2 new):**
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/ebayController.ts` — condition fix + aspect auto-fill + reconciliation function
- `packages/backend/src/utils/cloudinaryWatermark.ts` — QR 130→85px, g_south→g_south_east

- `claude_docs/specs/ebay-listing-reconciliation-spec.md` — NEW Architect spec
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/ebayController.ts` — push price priority inverted (organizer price wins over AI)

## Go-Live Blockers

**All P0/P1 env blockers cleared S465.** Remaining items are polish and QA.

| Priority | Item | Owner | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| ✅ | ~~Run S464 ebayNeedsReview migration~~ | Patrick | DONE S465 |
| ✅ | ~~Register live Stripe webhooks~~ | Patrick | DONE S465 — both endpoints live, correct event sets, screenshot-verified |
| ✅ | ~~Confirm webhook signing secrets match Railway~~ | Patrick | DONE S465 — Patrick confirmed |
| ✅ | ~~Vercel: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` live~~ | Patrick | DONE S465 — `pk_live_51T3kXh...` verified |

## Next Session Priority

**1. Push S491 wrap docs + S491 code (first thing):**
```powershell
git add claude_docs/STATE.md
git add claude_docs/patrick-dashboard.md
git add packages/backend/src/controllers/adminReportsController.ts
git add packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma
git add packages/database/prisma/migrations/20260416_ebay_push_quota/migration.sql
git add packages/backend/src/controllers/ebayController.ts
git add packages/backend/src/controllers/itemController.ts
git add packages/backend/src/controllers/treasureHuntQRController.ts
git add packages/backend/src/jobs/auctionJob.ts
git add packages/backend/src/controllers/authController.ts
git add packages/backend/src/services/referralService.ts
git add packages/backend/src/middleware/requireTier.ts
git add packages/backend/src/controllers/stripeController.ts
git commit -m "S491: admin reports fix, eBay push quota, 4 security fixes (XP caps, referral atomicity, grace period, payment dedup)"
.\push.ps1
```

**2. Run S491 migration (eBay push quota — schema change):**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\desee\ClaudeProjects\FindaSale\packages\database
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:QvnUGsnsjujFVoeVyORLTusAovQkirAq@maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:13949/railway"
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

**3. Chrome QA — admin reports fix (P0, low-confidence):**
Navigate to `/admin/reports` as admin. Verify Organizer Performance tab shows organizers. If still empty, re-dispatch `findasale-dev` with deeper diagnosis (may be a frontend data handling issue, not just the query).

**4. Chrome QA — security gates smoke test (P1, carry from S489):**
Register a new test account → verify email gate fires. Verify existing organizers are NOT blocked.

**5. Chrome QA — tier degradation smoke test (P1, carry from S489):**
As existing organizer (user2 SIMPLE), confirm no grace banner. Check DowngradePreviewModal renders from upgrade page.

**6. Orphaned pages — Patrick decisions needed (P1):**
Confirm which of these to wire into nav (dispatch `findasale-dev` after decisions):
- `/search` — main discovery page, currently unreachable from nav (RECOMMEND: add)
- `/organizer/pricing` — plan selection, unreachable (RECOMMEND: add)
- `/organizer/storefront/[slug]` — public storefront, unreachable (RECOMMEND: add)
- `/hall-of-fame` — in AvatarDropdown but not Layout.tsx (RECOMMEND: add to Layout)
- `/shopper/lucky-roll` — gamified discovery (in-progress or ready?)
- `/shopper/crews` — crew collaboration (in-progress or ready?)
- `/condition-guide` — reference page (add to shopper nav?)

**7. Full pricing + monetization review (P1):**
Dispatch `findasale-investor` + `findasale-hacker` jointly to audit all money surfaces before live customers.

**8. Delete seed accounts — after Chrome QA confirms app is healthy (P1):**
Safe to delete: all `user@example.com` (user1–user100) + `workandothers1@gmail.com`. Survivors: `deseee@gmail.com` + `artifactmi@gmail.com`. DB integrity clean as of S491.

**9. Root file cleanup (Patrick manual):**
Delete from repo root: `finda-sale-landing.html`, `organizer-video-ad.html`, `The_True_Plan.md`

**Carry-forward queue (lower priority):**
- Bump Post feed sort (needs Architect sign-off before dev dispatch)
- Price Research Card redesign (`claude_docs/design/PRICE_RESEARCH_CARD_UX_SPEC.md`)
- Brand audit copy: SharePromoteModal, homepage meta, organizer profile meta
- Referral fraud gate (D-XP-004)
- RankUpModal — built but not connected to AuthContext rank-change event
- Legendary item flag — no organizer UI to mark items Legendary yet

**Deferred:**
- Device fingerprinting Phase 2 (FingerprintJS — defer until beta scale justifies)
- Bounty redesign Phase 2
- Flea Market Events full implementation (ADR-014 locked, not yet staffed)
- Stripe Connect webhook config (items not marking SOLD after POS card payment — P2 since S421)
- Bounties dollars vs XP: open decision

**Postponed QA queue:**
- S436 earnings/qr-codes/staff
- S430 Yahoo spam test, iOS geolocation, print label
- S431 trail detail + trail stops on map
- S427 full invoice flow
- S433 auction reserve/proxy/soft-close/bid history/cron

## Standing Notes

- Railway backend: `https://backend-production-153c9.up.railway.app`
- Vercel frontend: `https://finda.sale`
- Test accounts: user1 (TEAMS), user2 (organizer SIMPLE), user3 Carol Williams (TEAMS), user11 Karen Anderson (shopper, Hunt Pass active), user12 Leo Thomas (shopper). All passwords: `password123`.
- **Survivor accounts (survive database nuke):** Admin → `deseee@gmail.com` | Teams Organizer → `artifactmi@gmail.com`. See `packages/database/prisma/survivor-seed.ts`.
- eBay: production credentials live in Railway. Browse + Trading + Taxonomy + Catalog APIs all live.
- POS test prerequisite: Organizer must have Stripe Connect configured; shopper must be linked via QR scan first.
- DB: Railway PostgreSQL (`maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:13949/railway`) — migration commands in CLAUDE.md §6.
- Backend route mounts: `app.use('/api/organizers', ...)`, `/api/sales`, `/api/trails`, `/api/boosts`, `/api/lucky-roll`.
- **Stripe Connect webhook (P2 — unresolved since S421):** Configure Stripe Dashboard → Events on Connected accounts → `payment_intent.succeeded` → `/api/webhooks/stripe` → Railway `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Without it, items don't mark SOLD after POS card payment.
- **STATE.md compacted S465 (2026-04-14):** Sessions S428–S449 archived to `COMPLETED_PHASES.md`. Prior compaction S?/2026-04-10 archived S427 and older. ~1350 lines removed this pass.
