## Active Objective

**Session 232 COMPLETE (2026-03-22) — COMPREHENSIVE LIVE QA AUDIT (24 BUGS, NO-GO):**
- ✅ Full live app QA audit at https://finda.sale — all roles (SHOPPER, ORGANIZER, ADMIN), all major flows
- ✅ Report written: `claude_docs/operations/qa-audit-2026-03-22.md`
- ⛔ **VERDICT: NO-GO for beta** — 2 P0 blockers
- 🔴 P0 BUG-01: `/messages/[conversationId]` page renders blank for all users — `min-h-screen` flex collapse in Layout wrapper
- 🔴 P0 BUG-02: Stripe checkout → `POST /api/billing/checkout` returns 404 HTML (JSON parse error; no Stripe redirect)
- 🟠 HIGH BUG-03: "Manage Plan" → no Stripe Customer Portal (dead end for PRO users)
- 🟠 HIGH BUG-04: `/admin/invites` crashes — `TypeError: n.map is not a function` (response.invites not destructured)
- 🟠 HIGH BUG-05: Follow button fires zero network requests; `/api/organizers/[id]/follow-status` → 404
- Medium/Low: broken Picsum images (BUG-06), unpopulated Edit Sale dates (BUG-07), unpopulated Edit Item category (BUG-08), billing section hardcoded light theme in dark mode (BUG-15), N+1 fetches (BUG-11/12), unicode escapes in badges (BUG-17/18), PWA prompt loop (BUG-24), 9 more
- Total: 2 P0 Critical · 3 High · 10 Medium · 9 Low = 24 bugs
- **Recommended fix order:** BUG-01 → BUG-02 → BUG-03 → BUG-04 → BUG-06 → BUG-07/08 → BUG-15 → BUG-17/18
- Last Updated: 2026-03-22

**Session 231 COMPLETE (2026-03-22) — BUG QUEUE COMPLETION + AVATAR DROPDOWN (P0 UX FIX):**
- ✅ BUG #22 verified live: Chrome test confirmed Nina (ADMIN) gets 200 from `GET /api/organizers/me` — fix working
- ✅ BUG #22 sweep: 54 inline `role !== 'ORGANIZER'` checks across 24 backend files (21 controllers + 3 routes) fixed
- ✅ BUG #30 fixed: `sales/[id].tsx` line 379 — `organizerId={sale.organizer.userId}` → `organizerId={sale.organizer.id}`
- ✅ BUG #31 fixed: `FavoriteButton.tsx` — SVG fill via explicit props instead of Tailwind classes
- ✅ BUG #32 fixed: `favoriteController.ts` — toggle checks DB for existing record before add/remove; verified live (bidirectional)
- ✅ BUG #33 fixed: `OnboardingModal.tsx` — handleSkip writes localStorage synchronously before onComplete()
- ✅ AvatarDropdown.tsx built (new): replaces 20+ inline desktop header auth links — Dashboard, Plan a Sale, Insights (PRO), Workspace (TEAMS), Subscription, Settings, Sign Out. P0 UX fix per nav-dashboard-consolidation-2026-03-20 spec.
- ✅ Layout.tsx: Desktop auth nav Feed link (was Explore → `/`); mobile Pro Tools using TierGatedNavLink
- ✅ Sale page UX: "Back to home" label, ~15 dark mode class additions
- ⚠️ PENDING PATRICK PUSH: `sales/[id].tsx` + 24 BUG #22 sweep backend files (see instructions in chat)
- ⚠️ PENDING: `prisma migrate deploy + prisma generate` against Neon (still blocking #73/#74/#75 runtime — NOT YET DONE)
- ⚠️ PENDING Railway env vars: `AI_COST_CEILING_USD=5.00`, `MAILERLITE_SHOPPERS_GROUP_ID=182012431062533831`
- Last Updated: 2026-03-22

**Session 230 COMPLETE (2026-03-21) — S227 QA AUDIT COMPLETION + BUG #22 BACKEND FIX:**
- ✅ Full 4-role deep functional QA audit completed (Chrome MCP browser automation, XHR/fetch interception, direct JWT API calls)
- ✅ BUG #22 backend confirmed: `GET /api/organizers/me` → 403 for Nina (ADMIN). Root cause: `requireOrganizer` checked `role === 'ORGANIZER'` (singular); Nina's JWT has `role: "ADMIN"`. Fixed in `auth.ts` (added `requireOrganizer` export) + `organizers.ts` (5 inline checks updated to also check `roles?.includes('ORGANIZER')`).
- ✅ BUG #30 confirmed dead: Follow button fires ZERO network requests (0 XHR, 0 fetch). Endpoint `POST /:id/follow` exists and is correct — bug is in frontend click handler. Flagged for separate frontend dispatch.
- ✅ Audit report written: `claude_docs/audits/s227-qa-audit.md`
- ✅ BUGs resolved since S222: #25 (items load), #29 (Message Organizer), #22 frontend, #20 shopper sort
- ⚠️ Still broken: BUG #22 backend (fix shipped S230, not yet live-verified), BUG #30 (frontend), BUG #31 (heart SVG fill), BUG #32 (favorites toggle always removes), BUG #33 (onboarding tour loops)
- ⚠️ 15 other backend files have same `role !== 'ORGANIZER'` pattern — needs follow-up sweep dispatch to findasale-dev
- ⚠️ PENDING: `prisma migrate deploy + prisma generate` against Neon (still blocking #73/#74/#75 runtime — NOT YET DONE)
- Last Updated: 2026-03-21

**Session 229 COMPLETE (2026-03-21) — RAILWAY/VERCEL BUILD REPAIR + FRONTEND QA AUDIT + #75 LAPSE BANNER FIX:**
- ✅ Railway build unblocked: stripeController.ts — 3x `findUnique`→`findFirst` for non-unique `stripeCustomerId`, null guard on `invoice.customer`, typed `(err: unknown)` catch handlers
- ✅ Vercel build unblocked: `useNotifications.ts` named import → default import for `api`
- ✅ Frontend QA audit: 2 BLOCKERs + 4 WARNs found and fixed same session
- ✅ BLOCKER 1 fixed: #75 lapse banner was permanently invisible — `tierLapsedAt` is on `UserRoleSubscription` not `Organizer`. Switched to `subscriptionStatus === 'canceled'` (IS on Organizer). Added `subscriptionStatus` to all 3 JWT payloads + `AuthContext.tsx` User type + both parsing blocks
- ✅ BLOCKER 2 fixed: Lapse banner CTA pointed to `/organizer/billing` (404) → changed to `/organizer/subscription`
- ✅ WARN fixed: `useNotifications.ts` hook was dead code (no callers) + polled without auth guard → deleted
- ✅ WARN fixed: `notifications.tsx` used `window.location.href` for all links → `router.push` for internal, `window.open` for external
- ⚠️ PENDING: `prisma migrate deploy + prisma generate` against Neon (still blocking #73/#74/#75 runtime — NOT YET DONE)
- Last Updated: 2026-03-21

**Session 228 COMPLETE (2026-03-21) — FEATURES #73/#74/#75 + PRICING PATCH + RAILWAY VERIFICATION:**
- ✅ Railway + Stripe verification: backend UP (health latency 200, /api/sales 200), Stripe checkout tested
- ✅ P1 pricing.tsx bug FIXED: double `/api/` path removed. Committed af096e0, pushed.
- ✅ Feature #73 — Two-Channel Notification System: notificationService.ts (DB + Resend email, fail-open), triggers in message/sale/stripe controllers
- ✅ Feature #74 — Role-Aware Registration Consent Flow: register.tsx inline consent checkboxes (unchecked default, role-conditional), authController RoleConsent records
- ✅ Feature #75 — Tier Lapse State Logic: tierLimits.ts + tierEnforcement.ts, stripeController webhook handlers, itemController 403 guard, dashboard lapse banner
- ✅ S228 11-file push CONFIRMED DONE (Patrick pushed; Vercel was building from it at S229 start)
- Last Updated: 2026-03-21

**Session 227 COMPLETE (2026-03-21) — WORKFLOW CLEANUP SPRINT (Phase 2+3):**
- ✅ Phase 2a: `daily-friction-audit` scheduled task updated with auto-dispatch action loop — HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW findings auto-dispatch findasale-records or findasale-dev; 3+ consecutive appearances → `## Patrick Direct` block
- ✅ Phase 2b: `context-freshness-check` changed from daily to weekly Monday 8am
- ✅ Phase 2c: QA audit on /pricing — 2 WARN findings FIXED in S228: unauthenticated button text, `?upgrade=success/cancelled` handling
- ✅ Phase 3a: `.checkpoint-manifest.json` and `MESSAGE_BOARD.json` deleted from active use
- ✅ Phase 3b: `context-maintenance` and `findasale-push-coordinator` skills archived — source SKILL.md files updated; .skill packages built
- ✅ Phase 3c: CORE.md fully retired — CLAUDE.md v5.0 is now the single authority
- ✅ CLAUDE.md 3-region merge conflict resolved — v5.0 §§7-12 intact
- ✅ Railway Dockerfile cache-bust pushed (commit 57fabb05) — forces fresh Docker build to unblock Stripe checkout 404
- ✅ Stripe checkout verified working in S228
- Last Updated: 2026-03-21

**Session 225 COMPLETE (2026-03-21) — COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT S212–S224 + CHROME VERIFICATION + 3 BUG FIXES:**
- ✅ Prisma migration (#72 Phase 2) confirmed applied by Patrick at session start. #73/#74/#75 now unblocked.
- ✅ All S224 features Chrome-verified: /pricing, /shopper/favorites, /shopper/messages, /organizer/messages, FavoriteButton, leaderboard sort, inspiration page
- ✅ Message Organizer button confirmed working in code (dev agent audit). Earlier test failure was stale auth state.
- ✅ Bug #1 FIXED: PWA banner reappears after "Not now" — added sessionStorage dual-layer to InstallPrompt.tsx
- ✅ Bug #2 FIXED: Shopper onboarding popup fires on wrong pages — added shopperFirstPages allowlist to _app.tsx
- ✅ Bug #3 FIXED: Inspiration page all images broken — added photoUrls fallback + placeholder to InspirationGrid.tsx
- ✅ DEPLOYED: InstallPrompt.tsx, _app.tsx, InspirationGrid.tsx — confirmed live at Vercel + Railway (commit 3c3d765)
- ⚠️ S205–S211 session history irrecoverable (not in session-log.md or archive). No known open bugs from those sessions.
- Health report: `claude_docs/health-reports/2026-03-21-s225-audit.md`
- Last Updated: 2026-03-21

**Session 224 COMPLETE (2026-03-21) — CHROME VERIFICATION + BUG SPRINT + FEATURE BUILD:**
- ✅ Chrome-verified /inspiration page LIVE — masonry grid rendering, items from multiple sales, no app errors
- ✅ Shopper leaderboard sort FIXED — was sorted by streakPoints (arbitrary), now computes display score first then sorts DESC. Frank (750pts) now #1, not #9.
- ✅ #28 PWA install banner FIXED — added session-state `dismissed` flag so banner does not reappear after "Not now" within same session
- ✅ #28 Duplicate Live Activity widget REMOVED — ActivityFeed import + render removed from sales/[id].tsx; LiveFeedTicker retained as sole widget
- ✅ #19 (sale detail 429 → "not found") — ALREADY FIXED in codebase, confirmed
- ✅ #24 (geolocation login stall) — ALREADY FIXED in codebase, confirmed
- ✅ #23 Pricing page BUILT — /pricing with SIMPLE/PRO/TEAMS comparison + Stripe checkout. Stripe prices created: Pro price_1TDUQsLTUdEUnHOTzG6cVDwu ($29/mo), Teams price_1TDUQtLTUdEUnHOTCEoNL6oz ($79/mo)
- ✅ #26 Favorite button BUILT — FavoriteButton.tsx + useFavorite.ts hook, integrated into ItemCard/InspirationGrid/sale detail, /shopper/favorites page enhanced
- ✅ #29 Message Organizer BUILT — MessageComposeModal.tsx + useConversations/useThread/useSendMessage/useReplyInThread hooks + /shopper/messages + /organizer/messages + /messages/[conversationId] thread view
- ⚠️ Architect spec saved: claude_docs/architecture/feature-specs-26-29-favorites-messages.md
- ⚠️ PENDING: prisma migrate deploy + prisma generate against Neon (#72 Phase 2 schema — blocks messaging runtime + #73/#74)
- ⚠️ Minor: Inspiration nav link missing from Layout nav (was added S218, may have been dropped). Low priority.
- Files pushed: 19 files via Patrick .\push.ps1. Leaderboard sort pushed earlier via MCP by subagent (violation noted).
- Last Updated: 2026-03-21

**Session 223 COMPLETE (2026-03-21) — S222 BUG FIX SPRINT + CHROME VERIFICATION + UX FIXES:**
- ✅ **7 of 18 S222 bugs FIXED (S223 early):** #22 (P0 role guards, 46 files), #25 (P1 items empty), #20 (P1 leaderboard sort), #30 (P1 CSRF follow), #15 (P2 reputation crash), #3 (P2 dashboard count), #7 (P2 How It Works)
- ✅ **BUG #25 deep fix:** `PUBLIC_ITEM_FILTER` disabled (set to `{}`) because legacy/seeded items have NULL `draftStatus` and Prisma rejects null on required String fields. Re-enable when Rapidfire Mode launches and NULLs are backfilled.
- ✅ **Chrome-verified deployed:** Sale detail items ✅, trending page ✅, homepage ✅, organizer leaderboard tab ✅, role guards ✅, dashboard count ✅, How It Works ✅, 429 toast ✅
- ✅ **Welcome popup scoped:** OrganizerOnboardingShower now only fires on /organizer, /dashboard, /manage-sales, /create-sale (was showing on all pages including /inspiration)
- ✅ **Install banner hardened:** InstallPrompt.tsx — mount-time state reset, double-check before showing, render-time guard
- ⚠️ **itemController.ts inspiration fix LOCAL ONLY:** `draftStatus: 'PUBLISHED'` → `...PUBLIC_ITEM_FILTER` at line ~1094. File too large for MCP push (40KB). Patrick must push manually.
- **Remaining unfixed bugs from S222:**
  - P1: Shopper leaderboard sort still broken (separate from organizer tab fix)
  - P2: #13 (Inspiration page empty — blocked by itemController push), #23 (subscription page — needs Stripe products), #26 (no favorite button — feature gap), #28 (Hunt Pass + PWA overlap), #29 (no Message Organizer — feature gap)
  - P3: #19 (sale detail "not found" on 429), #24 (login stalls on geolocation)
- Last Updated: 2026-03-21

- ✅ **Platform safety #94/#97/#98/#99 COMPLETE:** Coupon rate limiting (Redis, 10/min), admin pagination hard cap (100), request correlation IDs (UUID middleware), coupon collision retry (3 attempts).
- ✅ **P1 fix: Date input on create-sale** — FIXED. Added `min` attribute to both date inputs enabling HTML5 picker. Confirmed by Chrome audit.

**Session 221 COMPLETE (2026-03-21) — LIVE PRO FEATURE AUDIT AS OSCAR (USER2) + BUG FIXES:**
- ✅ **Railway unblocked:** leaderboardController.ts TS errors (TS2322/TS2339/TS7006) fixed — removed `userBadges` from select (not in inferred Docker Prisma type), replaced `nulls: 'last'` orderBy with JS null sort post-query, changed `take: 50` with `.slice(0, 20)` after sort.
- ✅ **Reputation page fully fixed:** Two bugs: (1) route was mounted at `app.use('/api', reputationRoutes)` → changed to `app.use('/api/organizers', reputationRoutes)` to match frontend calls to `/api/organizers/:id/reputation`; (2) page was passing `user.id` (User table cuid) instead of `organizer.id` (Organizer table cuid) — fixed by fetching `/organizers/me` and using returned `.id`.
- ✅ **fraud-signals.tsx:** `res.data.data` → `res.data.sales` (matches actual API response shape)
- ✅ **item-library.tsx:** Removed stray `<Layout>` wrapper
- ✅ **brand-kit.tsx:** Added `!data.id` guard before second API call; PRO fields (font/banner/accent) editable for PRO/TEAMS, disabled with upgrade prompt for SIMPLE
- ✅ **dashboard.tsx:** Welcome name uses `user?.name?.split(' ')[0] || 'there'`; How It Works section gated by `!orgProfile?.onboardingComplete`
