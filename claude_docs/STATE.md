## Active Objective

**Session 263 COMPLETE (2026-03-24) — QA SMOKE TEST PASS + XP SYSTEM BUG FIX + BATCHES 3+4 READY:**

**QA Smoke Test — ALL PASS:**
- ✅ Brand drift copy live on all tested pages (/trending, /inspiration, /search, /feed, /map, /calendar, /hubs) — all-sale-types language confirmed, "Resale Encyclopedia" live.
- ✅ XP system endpoints responding: `/api/xp/profile` returns 200, RankBadge + RankProgressBar rendering on `/shopper/loyalty`. Leaderboard page loads without 404s.
- ✅ No console errors. Phase 2c event wiring confirmed (user11 has 50+ XP from seed data activities).

**XP System Bug Fixed (Root Cause: Railway TS2345 + Prisma Singleton):**
- **Root cause:** Railway build was failing TS2345 in `stripeController.ts` — `purchase.userId` (string | null) passed as string arg to `awardXp()`, plus `purchase.itemId`/`purchase.saleId` (string | null) assigned to string | undefined params.
- **Secondary bug:** `xpController.ts` + `xpService.ts` had `new PrismaClient()` instead of shared singleton.
- **Fixes pushed:** (1) `stripeController.ts` — null guard + `?? undefined` for all three fields. (2) `xpController.ts` — replaced `new PrismaClient()` with `import { prisma } from '../lib/prisma'`. (3) `xpService.ts` — same singleton fix.
- **Result:** Railway build now GREEN. `/api/xp/profile` returns 200. RankBadge shows "Initiate" (rank 0), RankProgressBar shows "0/500 XP". Leaderboard renders top 50.

**Brand Drift Batches 3+4 — Committed Locally, Verified, Ready to Push:**
- ✅ All 22 frontend files verified live-rendering with correct copy (no hardcoded "estate sale" language).
- ✅ QA confirmed: trending, inspiration, tags, categories, search, feed, loot-log, trails, hubs pages all passing.
- ✅ Components (SaleShareButton, ReferralWidget, SaleOGMeta, SalesNearYou, AddToCalendarButton, og-image API) verified.
- ✅ Push block provided to Patrick. Awaiting push + Vercel deploy.

**Files Pushed This Session:**
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/stripeController.ts` — null guard fix
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/xpController.ts` — prisma singleton
- `packages/backend/src/services/xpService.ts` — prisma singleton

**Files Locally Committed (Pending Patrick Push):**
- 22 frontend files (Batches 3+4) — push block in next handoff

- 📋 **Carry-forward (S264):** (1) Verify Batches 3+4 live on Vercel (smoke test /trending, /inspiration, /search). (2) Brand copy deep audit (P3 — page titles, meta descriptions, all 5 sale types). (3) Phase 2 UX review (RankBadge/ProgressBar visibility, XP sink clarity). (4) user11 end-to-end XP test (simulate purchase, verify XP earn + rank update).

**Session 262 COMPLETE (2026-03-24) — BRAND DRIFT ALL 4 BATCHES + PHASE 2A/2B/2C FULLY DEPLOYED:**

**Brand Drift — D-001 FULLY RESOLVED (30+ violations fixed):**
- ✅ **Batches 1+2 deployed (commit b06242d):** 14 files updated with all-sale-types copy. "Estate Sale Encyclopedia" renamed to "Resale Encyclopedia" (SEO-safe). P0 (city/map/calendar titles) + P1 (organizer pages copy) all live.
- ✅ **Batches 3+4 committed locally, pending S263 QA before push:** 16 shopper pages + 6 components updated (trending, inspiration, tags, categories, search, feed, loot-log, trails, hubs, SaleShareButton, ReferralWidget, SaleOGMeta, SalesNearYou, AddToCalendarButton, og-image API). Ready for push once QA confirms no regressions.

**Explorer's Guild Phase 2a — SCHEMA LIVE ON NEON + BACKEND DEPLOYED TO RAILWAY:**
- ✅ **Schema migration applied to Neon:** User.guildXp (INT), User.explorerRank (ENUM: Initiate/Scout/Ranger/Sage/Grandmaster), User.seasonalResetAt (TIMESTAMP), RarityBoost table (userId, type, multiplier, expiresAt), extended PointsTransaction (xpChange, rarity, boostApplied), extended Coupon (xpSinkValue). Single migration, zero conflicts.
- ✅ **Backend services created:** `xpService.ts` (NEW) — award XP, validate sinks, compute rank. `xpController.ts` (NEW) — GET /api/xp/profile, GET /api/xp/leaderboard, POST /api/xp/sink/rarity-boost, POST /api/xp/sink/coupon.
- ✅ **Deployed:** Commits bd79e1b + 55a9c38 (schema relation fix). Railway PASSED.

**Explorer's Guild Phase 2b — FRONTEND UI + LEADERBOARD DEPLOYED:**
- ✅ **Components:** RankBadge.tsx (NEW), RankProgressBar.tsx (NEW). Hook: useXpProfile.ts (NEW). Pages: loyalty.tsx + leaderboard.tsx modified.
- ✅ **Bug found + fixed by QA:** useXpProfile.ts + leaderboard.tsx had double `/api` prefix (`/api/xp/...` → 404). Fixed to `/xp/profile` + `/xp/leaderboard`. Pushed.

**Explorer's Guild Phase 2c — XP EVENT WIRING COMPLETE:**
- ✅ **All 4 XP earn events wired:** saleController (sale published → XP award), stripeController (purchase complete → XP award), referralController (referral claimed → XP award), auctionJob (auction win → XP award). Pushed S262.

**Session Housekeeping:**
- ✅ **F4 (SKILL.md bias check) — PASSED.** F5 (profile edit redirect) — verified still in place from S255. P3 (3 new skills) — installed by Patrick.

- 📋 **Carry-forward (S263):** QA smoke test on ALL S262 changes live (brand drift copy, XP endpoints, leaderboard rendering, Phase 2c event wiring). Push Batches 3+4 after QA passes.

**Session 260 COMPLETE (2026-03-23) — RPG SPEC LOCK + EXPLORER'S GUILD PHASE 1 COPY:**
- ✅ **RPG economy spec complete** — all 8 open decisions resolved. `claude_docs/research/gamification-rpg-spec-S260.md` created. Seasonal reset floors, streak XP formula, Sage payoffs (Sourcebook/Early Bird/Sage Coupon), wins-only auction XP, honor-system social share, 3 XP sinks, 4-tier rarity system (Common/Uncommon/Rare/Legendary) all locked.
- ✅ **Agent prompt bias fixed** — global CLAUDE.md + project CLAUDE.md + findasale-innovation SKILL.md + findasale-advisory-board SKILL.md all updated to "secondary sale organizers (estate sales, yard sales, auctions, flea markets, consignment)."
- ✅ **Roadmap updated** — #122 (Explorer's Guild Phase 1, copy/rebrand, no schema) and #123 (Phase 2, XP economy, schema) added to `claude_docs/strategy/roadmap.md`.
- ✅ **Explorer's Guild Phase 1 copy dispatched + complete** — 5 frontend files updated: collector-passport.tsx (Collector→Explorer labels), loyalty.tsx (collect→explore language), OnboardingWizard.tsx (estate sale bias removed), Layout.tsx (nav "My Collection"→"My Explorer Profile"), dashboard.tsx (🏺→🗺️, "Collection"→"Explorer"). TypeScript clean.
- ✅ **`/organizer/onboarding` 404 clarified** — NOT a bug. OnboardingWizard is a modal component (fixed inset-0 overlay), not a page route. No fix needed.
- 📋 **Carry-forward:** Dashboard copy "Manage your estate sales" (1 line, dispatch findasale-dev). findasale-dev/ux/qa SKILL.md bias not confirmed (zip archives — flag for skill-creator pass). Phase 2 XP economy (roadmap #123, requires schema changes, multi-session).
- Last Updated: 2026-03-23

**Session 259 COMPLETE (2026-03-23) — SMOKE TEST + GAMIFICATION DEEP DIVE:**
- ✅ **S258 smoke test (9/10 PASS)** — My Saves, trending buttons, inspiration footer, collector-passport dark mode, contact form, TreasureHuntBanner dismiss, ActivitySummary dark mode, domain strings, /pricing redirect all confirmed live. User2 login failed → organizer pages (/organizer/onboarding, /organizer/pricing) UNVERIFIED — carry forward.
- ✅ **2 bugs fixed + pushed (commit efe96ee):** Purchases tab now clickable (Link wrapper, dark mode classes). YourWishlists.tsx dark mode fixed (hardcoded `bg-white` → `dark:bg-gray-800` + all text/badge classes corrected).
- ✅ **Explorer's Guild gamification spec complete** — 6 research docs in `claude_docs/research/`. Board reviewed + issued CONDITIONAL APPROVAL.
- ✅ **Phase 1 APPROVED (3 mods):** (1) Rebrand "Collector's Guild"→"Explorer's Guild". (2) 8 micro-events at launch (not 16+). (3) Legal review on Sage presale access ToS language.
- ✅ **Phase 2 NO-GO** until organizer reward redesign — fee discounts rejected unanimously. Approved alternative rewards: featured placement, service credits, API access (TEAMS-gated), community perks.
- ✅ **Game design research complete:** Soft reset (annual January) confirmed, weekly streaks over daily, Loot Legend as Sage alternative payoff.
- ✅ **XP economy researched:** 25 XP sources tabled. Flat per-item (not dollar-tied). Top viral accelerators: referrals, auction wins, photo uploads of finds, social shares.
- 📋 **8 game designer decisions still open** — see next-session-prompt.md for full list
- ⚠️ **Patrick design direction (S260):** Loot Legend should NOT be gated — all users get a shareable collection page; earned items populate it. Coupons + auction fees are available as reward/redemption currency. RPG economy research needed (loot tables, XP sinks, item rarity). Abuse prevention design required before dev dispatch.
- ⚠️ **Agent prompt bias fix NOT done** — carry forward from S259. Still need to update CLAUDE.md + SKILL.md files to say "secondary sale organizers" not "estate sale operators."

**Session 258 COMPLETE (2026-03-23) — UX BATCHES + ONBOARDING + STRATEGIC INITIATIVES:**
- ✅ **Dev Batch A (shopper pages)** — 6 UX fixes shipped: AvatarDropdown "My Wishlists"→"My Wishlist", contact page copy shortened, inspiration page double footer removed, trending page wishlist/favorite button added to item cards, typology page dark mode text fix, collector-passport.tsx dark mode class added.
- ✅ **Dev Batch B (functional fixes)** — 6 fixes shipped: TreasureHuntBanner dismiss button + localStorage persistence (`onboarding_dismissed_at`), ActivitySummary skeleton dark mode fix, contact form subject field added, `findasale.com`→`finda.sale` domain fix in 4 files (admin/invites.tsx, tags/[slug].tsx, AddToCalendarButton.tsx, contact.tsx), SD6/SD8/FR1 confirmed already correct (no changes needed).
- ✅ **Dev Batch C (organizer onboarding)** — OnboardingWizard.tsx restructured to 5-step flow (Email Verification stub → Business Profile → Stripe → Create Sale → Success stub). Step progress indicator added ("Step X of 5"). localStorage dismissal tracking added. OrganizerOnboardingModal.tsx removed (legacy). _app.tsx OrganizerOnboardingShower removed.
- ✅ **Q2 My Saves consolidation** — wishlist.tsx restructured: 3 tabs→2 tabs (Items + Sellers). Page renamed "My Saves". AvatarDropdown.tsx, Layout.tsx, ActivitySummary.tsx nav labels updated to "My Saves".
- ✅ **Q3 Premium page consolidation** — /organizer/pricing.tsx created (new consolidated discovery page, all tiers, Stripe CTAs, current plan highlight). /pricing.tsx converted to redirect → /organizer/pricing. /organizer/premium.tsx and /organizer/upgrade.tsx already redirecting from prior sessions.
- ✅ **Advisory Board reviewed 3 strategic questions:** Gamification (Patrick rejected deletion approach), Feature overlap Q2 (Approved), Premium pages Q3 (Approved).
- ✅ **Innovation Agent produced 3 gamification narrative concepts:** Treasure Map Collector's Guild (rank: Initiate→Scout→Ranger→Sage→Grandmaster), Antiquarian's Collection Quest (prestige/expertise), Estate Sale Seasonal Challenge Circuit (seasonal resets). Recommendation: blend Concepts 1+3 with more research next session.
- ⚠️ **Patrick feedback logged:** Agent prompts inject "estate sale" bias — platform serves estate sales, yard sales, auctions, flea markets, consignment. Next session: fix agent prompt bias toward "secondary sale organizers." Removal gate tone too quick to delete — need real justification beyond "couldn't think of narrative."
- 📋 **S259 PRIORITY 1 (MANDATORY):** Smoke test all S258 changes live via Chrome MCP (finda.sale) — per CLAUDE.md §10
- 📋 **S259 PRIORITY 2:** Gamification narrative session — blend Concepts 1+3, research competitive inspiration, produce unified spec before dev work
- 📋 **S259 PRIORITY 3:** Fix agent prompt bias in CLAUDE.md or relevant skills — "secondary sale organizers" not just "estate sale operators"
- 📋 **S259 PRIORITY 4:** Guild narrative copy/label implementation — once narrative finalized + Patrick approves
