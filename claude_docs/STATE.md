## Active Objective

Session 105 Bug Blitz COMPLETE. Session 106 B1 ADR COMPLETE. Session 107 B1 implementation COMPLETE. Session 109 skill packaging COMPLETE. Session 110 P1 bug blitz COMPLETE. Full detail: `claude_docs/COMPLETED_PHASES.md`.

**Session 111 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Build fixes + fleet research + credential rotation + workflow improvements.
- Fixed Railway TS2322 (itemSearchService.ts intersection types) and Vercel form reset (add-items/[saleId].tsx)
- Scrubbed live Neon credentials from next-session-prompt.md (Session 110 wrap error) — pushed immediately
- Added CORE.md §17.3(c) credential hard gate — next-session-prompt.md must NEVER contain credentials
- Fixed coupons.ts ERR_ERL_KEY_GEN_IPV6: `ipKeyGenerator(ip)` with proper import (3 iterations to get signature right)
- Rotated Neon credentials (Patrick completed in console)
- Fleet dispatched: B2 ✓ (AI disclosure copy), H1 ✓ (UX inspiration research), D3 ✓ (route planning ADR → Option B approved), G-batch ✓ (rerun: only Vercel MCP actionable, rest CLI-only)
- conversation-defaults skill updated to v2 (8 rules, AskUserQuestion restored, blocked-task handling)
- Vercel MCP connected
- 3 Neon migrations still pending deploy (Patrick ran command but hit wrong package path — not yet deployed)

**Remaining open:** A3.6 single-item 500 (needs production logs). B2 (copy written, needs UI wiring). D3 (ADR approved, ready for dev). H1 quick wins (How It Works card + compact header). B3/B7/D1/C1/C2 (deferred/attorney). Vercel MCP connected but not yet leveraged.

## Locked Decisions

- **BUSINESS_PLAN.md** — Tier 1 Strategic Authority Document (created 2026-03-06). All business strategy, market analysis, financial projections, competitive positioning, and go-to-market strategy defined here. Reference for all strategic decisions.
- **Platform fee: 10% flat** across all item types (FIXED, AUCTION, REVERSE_AUCTION, LIVE_DROP, POS) — locked 2026-03-10. `FeeStructure` DB table, single row, rate configurable without code deploy. Replaces 5%/7% split. All-in ~13.2% with Stripe. Tier discounts deferred post-beta. See STACK.md.
- Stripe Connect Express
- Leaflet + OSM maps, backend geocoding cache
- Cloudinary image storage
- PWA enabled
- Socket.io live bidding (Sprint V1 — shipped)
- Stripe Connect Express payouts (instant payout schedule — Sprint V2 — shipped)

## Completed Phases (summary)

Phases 1–13 + pre-beta audit + rebrand + Sprints A–X all verified and shipped (21 phases total). Full detail: `claude_docs/COMPLETED_PHASES.md`

---

## In Progress

**3 Neon migrations — ✅ DEPLOYED (Session 112, confirmed by Patrick).** 66 total applied.
1. `20260309_add_auction_reserve_price`
2. `20260310000001_add_item_fulltext_search_indexes`
3. `20260311000001_add_sale_type_item_listing_type`

For future migration deploys, see `claude_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and `packages/backend/.env` (commented-out Neon URLs). Never embed credentials in committed files (CORE.md §17.3c).

---

## Pending Manual Action (Blocks Beta Launch)

- **Phase 31 OAuth env vars** — ✅ DONE (2026-03-06). GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET + FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID/SECRET added to Vercel. Redirect URIs configured.
- **Support email** — ✅ DONE (2026-03-06). support@finda.sale email forwarding configured.
- **Neon migrations** — ✅ 66 applied (Session 112). All caught up.
- **Neon credentials** — ✅ Rotated (Session 111). Old exposed password scrubbed from git history.
- **conversation-defaults skill** — ✅ v2 installed (Session 111).

---

## Deferred (Post-Beta)

- AI Discovery Feed (ML on browse/buy signals — needs real data)
- Buyer-to-Sale Matching (ML — needs real data)
- Treasure Hunt mobile UX improvements
- Visual Search vector embeddings (upgrade from label matching)
- Group Buying Pools, White-label MaaS, Consignment Integration
- Video-to-inventory (vision models not ready)
- Multi-metro expansion

---

## Beta Launch Target

**Status: GO.** All 8 audit work paths complete (session 84). All 4 critical code fixes shipped (session 85).

**4 critical code fixes — ✅ COMPLETE (session 85):**
- C1: ✅ JWT fallback secret removed, env var validation guard added on startup
- C2: ✅ Password reset rate-limited (5/hr) via express-rate-limit on `/auth/forgot-password`
- C3: ✅ `/api/upload/ai-feedback-stats` protected with `authenticate` + `requireAdmin` middleware
- C4: ✅ Stripe webhook secret rotation plan documented in OPS.md

**Patrick's 5 blocking items:**
1. ~~Confirm 5%/7% fee~~ — ✅ DONE. Locked at 10% flat (Session 106).
2. Set up Stripe business account
3. Google Search Console verification
4. Order business cards (design ready in `claude_docs/brand/`)
5. Start beta organizer outreach (`claude_docs/beta-launch/organizer-outreach.md` + `marketing-calendar-2026-03-06.md`)
6. ~~Rotate Neon credentials~~ — ✅ DONE (Session 111).
7. Optional: consult Michigan attorney re estate sale permit (~$300–500)

## Known Gotchas (Production)

- **Railway PORT mismatch** — `PORT=5000` locked in Railway Variables. Must match `EXPOSE 5000` in Dockerfile. Do not remove.
- **Neon production DB** — `prisma migrate deploy` must be run manually after any new migration. 66 applied as of 2026-03-09. Run from `packages/database` (NOT `packages/backend`).
- **Dockerfile.production** — ✅ Restored to `--frozen-lockfile` (session 87, commit b82180d). Lockfile is clean.
- **Git push workflow** — Patrick uses `.\push.ps1` (repo root) instead of raw `git push`. Self-heals: index.lock, CRLF phantoms (--ignore-cr-at-eol), fetch+merge (never rebase), doc-file merge conflicts (--theirs auto-resolve). See self-healing entries #36, #51, #52.
- **Dev stack is now native** — Docker no longer used at all. `image-tagger/` deleted by Patrick (session 81). Backend/frontend/postgres run natively on Windows. See `claude_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- **Production migration deploy (Neon):** Before running `migrate deploy`, Claude must read `packages/backend/.env` directly to confirm the Neon URLs are present (commented-out `# DATABASE_URL=` and `# DIRECT_URL=` lines pointing to `neon.tech`). Claude provides the migration command template only — Patrick reads credentials directly from `packages/backend/.env`. Never embed credentials in any committed file. See SECURITY.md §3.

## Constraints

- Token efficiency required — keep Tier 1 docs lean
- Diff-only updates
- Grand Rapids beta first — scope is not geography-limited; yard sales, auctions, and flea markets are in scope

---

- **favicon.ico** — ✅ COMPLETE. Multi-size ICO (16/32/48px) from logo-icon-512.png. `_document.tsx` updated with shortcut/icon links. Pushed 2026-03-05.
- **CA4** — ✅ COMPLETE. User flow audit (shopper/organizer/creator). 10 fixes shipped: search aria-label, purchases error handling, index refetch(), items/[id] retry, referral copy feedback. Open items logged in `claude_docs/ux-spotchecks/ca4-ca6-audit-2026-03-05.md`.
- **CA6** — ✅ COMPLETE. Feature polish: 5MB photo validation + server error surfacing, push notification toggle in organizer settings, onboarding step 3 copy improved, empty referrals state. Pushed 2026-03-05.

Last Updated: 2026-03-09 (session 112 — scrubbed credentials from STATE.md, migrations confirmed deployed)
