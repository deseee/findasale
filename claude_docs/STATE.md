## Active Objective

**Session 139 COMPLETE (2026-03-11) — CONVERSATION-DEFAULTS V4 SKILL PACKAGED:**
Packaged conversation-defaults v4 as a proper `.skill` file using the skill-creator packaging workflow. Rule 13 added: post-diagnosis routing gate — orchestrator must route implementation to the appropriate subagent (findasale-dev for code, findasale-records for docs/skills), not inline. Fixed frontmatter validation issue (removed non-standard `version`/`last_updated` keys before packaging). Skill file delivered to Patrick's workspace for installation via "Copy to your skills". This resolves the workflow gap identified in session 138.

**Session 138 COMPLETE (2026-03-11) — RAPIDFIRE REVIEW PAGE BUGS FIXED:**
Three bugs fixed after Rapidfire mode use: (1) New draft items not appearing on review page — root cause: `GET /api/items` uses `PUBLIC_ITEM_FILTER` (PUBLISHED only), added new `getDraftItemsBySaleId` controller + `GET /api/items/drafts` route; (2) 19 old items showing "Analyzing..." with broken photos — same root cause, fixed by the new `/drafts` endpoint which explicitly includes `draftStatus` in select; (3) Edit buttons on review page broken — `setSelectedPreviewId()` was called but no modal existed in review.tsx, fixed to `router.push('/organizer/edit-item/:id')`. TypeScript compiled clean on both backend and frontend. Pushed to GitHub (commit 35b4f85), Patrick committed locally and ran push.ps1.
Files changed: `packages/backend/src/controllers/itemController.ts`, `packages/backend/src/routes/items.ts`, `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/add-items/[saleId]/review.tsx`.

**Session 137 COMPLETE (2026-03-11) — RAPIDFIRE BUG FIX + ENFORCEMENT HARDENING:**
Two critical bugs fixed: (1) Prisma P2022 — `Item.draftStatus` missing from Neon production DB — fixed by deploying migration `20260311000002_add_item_draft_status`; (2) Rapidfire camera button bug — clicking Rapidfire opened regular camera flow instead of rapid capture flow — fixed with `handleRapidCameraComplete` handler in add-items/[saleId].tsx, creates optimistic DRAFT items per photo. Workflow improvements: skill enforcement gates hardened across `conversation-defaults` and `dev-environment`, CORE.md env gate upgraded to hard STOP gate with explicit `Skill()` invocation, SECURITY.md §6 updated with no-placeholder-credential rule, skill packaging workflow fixed. Global CLAUDE.md updated with subagent-first rule. Files changed: `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/add-items/[saleId].tsx`, plus docs/skills already pushed to GitHub.

**ACTION REQUIRED (Patrick):** Deploy migration `20260311000002_add_item_draft_status` to Neon with: `cd packages/database && npx prisma migrate deploy` (with real credentials from packages/backend/.env).

**Session 136 COMPLETE (2026-03-10) — RAPIDFIRE MODE IMPLEMENTATION:**
Phases 1A–3C fully built and pushed to GitHub. QA verdict: PASS WITH NOTES. One migration pending Neon deploy — everything else is live on Railway/Vercel once Patrick deploys.

**What was built (all pushed to main):**
- Migration `20260311000002_add_item_draft_status` — draftStatus/aiErrorLog/optimisticLockVersion + backfill + indexes
- `helpers/itemQueries.ts` — PUBLIC_ITEM_FILTER, getPublicItemsBySaleId
- `jobs/processRapidDraft.ts` — background AI analysis (setImmediate, non-throwing)
- `jobs/cleanupStaleDrafts.ts` — 7-day DRAFT cleanup cron (2am daily)
- `uploadController.ts` — uploadRapidfire endpoint
- `itemController.ts` — getItemDraftStatus + publishItem (B2+B5 enforced) + BLOCKER fix (createItem/importItemsFromCSV now set draftStatus: 'PUBLISHED')
- `routes/items.ts` — new routes registered before /:id
- `index.ts` — scheduleCleanupCron() wired at startup
- Search service + routes — all updated with PUBLIC_ITEM_FILTER
- Frontend: ModeToggle, CaptureButton, RapidCarousel, PreviewModal, useUploadQueue hook
- Frontend: review.tsx page, add-items/[saleId].tsx Phase 3C integration

**⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED (Patrick):**
1. `git pull` to get all MCP-pushed commits
2. `cd packages/database && npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy` on Neon
3. Railway will redeploy automatically after pull+push (or trigger manually)
4. Test Rapidfire flow end-to-end after Neon deploy

**Known Phase 3C gaps (post-beta):**
- `useUploadQueue` not fully wired to camera blob capture (upload queue scaffolded, wiring incomplete)
- `rapidItems` not loaded on mount from existing DB drafts (review page starts empty on revisit)

**Session 135 COMPLETE (2026-03-10) — RAPIDFIRE MODE DESIGN SPRINT:**
Full design package complete and greenlit. Files: rapidfire-mode-adr.md, rapidfire-mode-ux-spec.md, rapidfire-mode-design-brief.md, rapidfire-dev-session-prompt.md.

---

Session 105 Bug Blitz COMPLETE. Session 106 B1 ADR COMPLETE. Session 107 B1 implementation COMPLETE. Session 109 skill packaging COMPLETE. Session 110 P1 bug blitz COMPLETE. Full detail: `claude_docs/COMPLETED_PHASES.md`.

**Session 113 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Fleet audit + governance overhaul.
- 11-subagent management audit. Fleet grade: D+. Root causes confirmed: honor-system rules, no enforcement gates, no token visibility, 6 of 7 Session 108 fixes never implemented.
- CORE.md v2: consolidated 19 rules → 5 (compression logging + read-before-write hard rule added). ~427 → 107 lines.
- 188 stale docs removed from git (archive-for-removal). Repo: 255 → 67 doc files.
- session-scoreboard-template.json added. session-digest scheduled task (8am daily) created.
- Unused plugins disabled by Patrick.

**Session 112 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Security fix + workflow audit + H1 quick win.
- Scrubbed live Neon credentials, workflow audit + 3 CORE.md fixes, H1 "How It Works" card shipped.

**Session 115 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** P0 security + payment fixes shipped. Token tracking research complete.
- Security fixes: OAuth account-takeover removed (no auto-link by email), redirect_uri allowlist added, tokenVersion-based session invalidation on password change
- Payment fixes: chargeback webhook handler (DISPUTED status), webhook idempotency (ProcessedWebhookEvent), negative price guards in itemController, buyer-own-item purchase guard
- Migrations: `20260309000002_add_token_version`, `20260309200001_add_processed_webhook_event` (Patrick must deploy)
- Research: token-tracking-feasibility.md — IMPLEMENT YES (hybrid approach: budget briefing + checkpoints)
- Migration naming fix: corrected two agent-generated migrations with conflicting names

**Session 114 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** D3 + B2 + H1 shipped. Agent fleet (6 workers) completed.
- D3: Map route planning — OSRM backend controller, routes.ts, routeApi.ts, RouteBuilder.tsx, wired into map.tsx
- B2: AI tagging disclosure — items/[id].tsx, organizer/add-items/[saleId].tsx, organizer/settings.tsx updated with approved copy
- H1: Compact mobile header — search bar py-1.5, main content pt-[92px]

**Session 116 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Token tracking + 3 features shipped.
- Token tracking (P1): CORE.md §3 updated with checkpoint format, `operations/token-checkpoint-guide.md` created, conversation-defaults skill v3 packaged
- Feature #4 (Search by Item Type): `categories/index.tsx` created — /categories landing page with category cards sorted by item count. `[category].tsx` already existed (Phase 29).
- Feature #12 (SEO Description Optimization): `cloudAIService.ts` Haiku prompt — titles now format "[Type], [Material], [Maker]"; tags 5–8 terms biased toward material/era/maker keywords
- Feature #9 (Payout Transparency Dashboard): `GET /api/stripe/earnings` + `payouts.tsx` — per-item breakdown: sale price → 10% platform fee → est. Stripe fee → net payout. Summary totals + full item table on payouts page.

**Session 117 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Feature #11 + Vercel build fix + Feature #10 + earningsPDF fix.
- Feature #11 (Organizer Referral Reciprocal): `stripeController.ts` — fee bypass when `referralDiscountExpiry > now` (0% instead of 10%); `routes/organizers.ts` — `GET /organizers/me` exposes `referralDiscountActive` + `referralDiscountExpiry`; `payouts.tsx` — green referral discount banner when active. MCP commit 3243091.
- Vercel build fix: `pages/items/[id].tsx` — renamed `triggerToast` → `showToast` (6 occurrences). MCP commit 949d743.
- Feature #10 (Serendipity Search): `packages/backend/src/routes/search.ts` — `GET /api/search/random`; `packages/frontend/pages/surprise-me.tsx` — /surprise-me page with filters. Commit 5473c14.
- earningsPdfController fee fix: footer updated from "5%/7%" to "Platform fee: 10% flat." Commit bd34de4.
- A3.6 single-item 500: ✅ RESOLVED — no errors in latest Railway deploy (confirmed by Patrick, session 119).
- New migration: `20260312000001_add_organizer_referral_discount` — adds `referralDiscountExpiry DateTime?` to Organizer. Patrick must deploy.

**Session 129 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Dashboard/UX polish + build error chain resolved.
- BUG-1 (P1): Edit Sale 404 fixed — route corrected to `/organizer/edit-sale/${id}`
- BUG-2 (P2): Stale fee copy fixed across dashboard + tierService (all tiers → 10% flat)
- CSVImportModal prop mismatch fixed (`onSuccess` → `onImportComplete`, added `isOpen`)
- Backend TypeScript error: removed `quantity` from Prisma `item.update()` (field not in schema); `bulkUpdateItems` extended to support `isActive` and `price` operations
- `sales/[id].tsx` restored (was truncated to 100 lines by prior MCP push — restored full 923-line file)
- BUG-3 (/organizer/items 404): Advisory Board + Pitchman consulted. Manage Holds button removed from dashboard as interim. Full feature deferred.
- Dashboard Analytics tab removed (duplicate of Insights page). Tabs reduced to Overview + Sales.
- Tier Rewards card cleaned up: removed fee sub-card, removed "better rates" copy, added tier descriptions.
- Print Inventory fixed: was calling `/organizer/sales` (404) → corrected to `/sales/mine`.
- ⚠️ Add-items page: two versions exist. Old single-form version at `/organizer/add-items` (no saleId). New tabbed version (Rapid Capture, Camera, CSV Import) at `/organizer/add-items/[saleId]`. Camera tab shows "coming soon" — needs audit next session.

**Session 131 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Print inventory fix + per-sale insights filter. Verified live.
- Print Inventory 500 error fixed: `getItemsBySaleId` was returning `embedding Float[]` (thousands of floats per item), crashing JSON serialization. Added `select` clause excluding embedding. Commit 10c66a5.
- Per-sale insights: `insightsController.ts` now accepts optional `?saleId` query param + returns `salesList` for dropdown. `insights.tsx` has sale selector dropdown, scoped metrics, dynamic subtitle. Commit 3cfc1ad.
- Both fixes verified live in Chrome: print inventory loads all 43 items; insights dropdown filters correctly (tested "Downtown Downsizing" → 1 sale, 17 items, $1,629.22 revenue).
- Minor data quality note: "Collectibles" appears twice in insights category breakdown (capitalization variant from seed data).
- Scoped AI branding audit for next session: 6 user-facing locations reference "Google Vision", "Claude Haiku", or "Anthropic" by name → should say "AI" generically.

**Session 130 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Session 129 compression damage audit + fixes.
- Audited all session 129 claimed fixes against live site + GitHub code
- Found stale 5%/7% fee copy in 3 customer-facing pages missed by session 129: terms.tsx (Section 6), faq.tsx (2 locations), guide.tsx (4 locations)
- All 3 pages fixed and pushed to GitHub (commits 926a2d7 + 726146f). Vercel deployed — confirmed live via Chrome.
- Old `add-items.tsx` (48KB static page, no saleId) replaced with redirect to `/organizer/dashboard` — eliminates routing conflict with `add-items/[saleId].tsx`
- Backend tierService.ts perks text confirmed correct on GitHub ("10% flat") — Railway deploy pending (stale instance still shows 5%/7% in dashboard tier perks card)
- ⚠️ Carry-forward: Camera tab "coming soon" regression on add-items/[saleId].tsx not yet investigated


**Session 126 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Docs correction + session 125 fix verification + item list audit.
- Session 125 fixes verified live in Chrome: BUG-1 (PUT fix) ✅, BUG-2 (organizer null crash) ✅, BUG-3 (dropdown case) ✅
- Organizer item list audit: all bulk actions pass (hide, show, set price, checkboxes). Per-item edit + delete pass.
- 3 new findings: FINDING-1 (no filter/sort on list, P2), FINDING-2 (native confirm on delete, P2), FINDING-3 (stale 5%/7% fee copy on dashboard, P2).
- Audit report: `claude_docs/audits/session-126-dashboard-items-audit.md`

**Session 125 COMPLETE (2026-03-10) — FIXES VERIFIED:** Edit-item + photo management flow audit via Chrome MCP. 4 critical bugs found + fixed. Code pushed (b2ac5c7). All fixes confirmed in production (session 126).
- P0: Save Changes broken (api.patch → api.put mismatch in edit-item/[id].tsx). Fixed — verified ✅
- P0: Shopper item detail page crashes on every item (TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') — organizer null in API response). Fixed with optional chaining + fallback — verified ✅
- P1: Category/Condition dropdowns blank on edit page (case mismatch). Fixed — verified ✅
- P2: No error state when item not found on edit page. Fixed — pushed, untested.
- Photo ops verified in audit: upload, reorder, delete all working correctly.
- ⚠️ Two remaining issues NOT fixed: (1) backend `getItemById` omits `organizer` from Prisma select (should be fixed in backend); (2) edit page uses public endpoint that filters ENDED/DRAFT items (organizer can't edit items on closed sales).
- Files: `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/edit-item/[id].tsx`, `packages/frontend/pages/items/[id].tsx`.
- Commit: b2ac5c7. Audit report: `claude_docs/audits/session-125-edit-item-photo-audit.md`.

**Session 120 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Beta dry run friction blitz. 13/15 items implemented (items 7 + 13 deferred). Vercel build cascade fixed (6 type errors in items/[id].tsx after agent full-file rewrite). QA P2 fixes: z-index, per-field validation. Docs: migration rollback plan, beta organizer email, spring content, dry run friction log.

**Session 119 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Records audit sessions 110–118. 4 drift items corrected (earningsPDF fix, Feature #10, roadmap checkmarks, A3.6). Manifest test PASS — first full live session with `.checkpoint-manifest.json`.

**Remaining open:** B3/B7/D1/C1/C2 (deferred/attorney). VAPID keys confirm in prod. Vercel MCP not yet leveraged. Feature #11 Referral Discount requires Neon migration deploy before active in production.

- Buyer-to-Sale Matching (ML — needs real data)
- Treasure Hunt mobile UX improvements
- Visual Search vector embeddings (upgrade from label matching)
- Group Buying Pools, White-label MaaS, Consignment Integration
- Video-to-inventory (vision models not ready)
- Multi-metro expansion

---

## Beta Launch Target

**Status: GO.** All 8 audit work paths complete (session 84). All 4 critical code fixes shipped (session 85).

**4 critical code fixes — ✅ COMPLETE (session 85):**
- C1: ✅ JWT fallback secret removed, env var validation guard added on startup
- C2: ✅ Password reset rate-limited (5/hr) via express-rate-limit on `/auth/forgot-password`
- C3: ✅ `/api/upload/ai-feedback-stats` protected with `authenticate` + `requireAdmin` middleware
- C4: ✅ Stripe webhook secret rotation plan documented in OPS.md

**Patrick's 5 blocking items:**
1. ~~Confirm 5%/7% fee~~ — ✅ DONE. Locked at 10% flat (Session 106).
2. Set up Stripe business account
3. Google Search Console verification
4. Order business cards (design ready in `claude_docs/brand/`)
5. Start beta organizer outreach (materials archived — rebuild fresh from strategy/roadmap.md)
6. ~~Rotate Neon credentials~~ — ✅ DONE (Session 111).
7. Optional: consult Michigan attorney re estate sale permit (~$300–500)

Full audit reports: archived (git history, sessions 84–85). Beta checklist: archived.

## Known Gotchas (Production)

- **Railway PORT mismatch** — `PORT=5000` locked in Railway Variables. Must match `EXPOSE 5000` in Dockerfile. Do not remove.
- **Neon production DB** — `prisma migrate deploy` must be run manually after any new migration. 66 applied as of 2026-03-09. Run from `packages/database` (NOT `packages/backend`).
- **Dockerfile.production** — ✅ Restored to `--frozen-lockfile` (session 87, commit b82180d). Lockfile is clean.
- **Git push workflow** — Patrick uses `.\push.ps1` (repo root) instead of raw `git push`. Self-heals: index.lock, CRLF phantoms (--ignore-cr-at-eol), fetch+merge (never rebase), doc-file merge conflicts (--theirs auto-resolve). See self-healing entries #36, #51, #52.
- **Dev stack is now native** — Docker no longer used at all. `image-tagger/` deleted by Patrick (session 81). Backend/frontend/postgres run natively on Windows. See `claude_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- **Production migration deploy (Neon):** Claude reads `packages/backend/.env` from the VM, extracts the commented-out Neon URLs, and provides a ready-to-paste command with real credentials in chat output (ephemeral — never committed). Never embed credentials in any committed file. See SECURITY.md §3 and CORE.md §17.3(c).

---

## Constraints

- Token efficiency required — keep Tier 1 docs lean
- Diff-only updates
- Grand Rapids beta first — scope is not geography-limited; yard sales, auctions, and flea markets are in scope

---

**Session 133 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Session 128 audit regression fixes + edit-item P2022 crash fix.
- Session 128 regressions restored: RapidCapture torch toggle, camera switch, photo upload, tab reorder, bulk delete — commit faa16f4
- AI vendor branding genericized: faq.tsx + privacy.tsx — "Google Vision" / "Claude Haiku" references replaced with "AI" — commit aa7ae46
- add-items/[saleId].tsx: tab reorder, photo upload wiring, bulk delete restore — commit d7648e1
- **P0 bug fixed:** `getItemById` (GET /items/:id) was crashing with P2022 — `Item.tags` column doesn't exist in production DB (migration never created). Switched from `include` to explicit `select`, excluding `tags` and `embedding` — commit aa13deb. Verified live in Chrome: edit-item page loads correctly.
- ✅ Resolved in session 134: `Item.tags` migration created (`20260310000002_add_item_tags`) and deployed. All bare `include` endpoints confirmed safe.

**Session 134 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Auction job P2022 fix + session wrap.
- Diagnosed `auctionJob` P2022 crash: `Item.tags` column missing from Neon production DB, no migration file existed.
- Created migration `20260310000002_add_item_tags` (`ALTER TABLE "Item" ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "tags" TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`).
- Also committed two other missing migrations: `20260309000002_add_token_version` and `20260309200001_add_processed_webhook_event`.
- `prisma migrate deploy` confirmed no pending — column already on Neon. All Item `include` endpoints (auction job, updateItem, deleteItem, etc.) are safe.
- ⚠️ Deferred (post-beta): `exportItems` (itemController line 815) and `trendingController` pull full `embedding[]` (768 floats/item) with no `select` — performance concern on large sales, not a crash.
- Two items NOT completed this session (interrupted): hide/show/selected bar move to top of item list, test CSV file for import.

**Session 128 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Chrome QA audit of session 127/128 changes. FINDING-3 fixed. CSV import 500 bug found and fixed.
- Chrome audit PASS: tab labels ✅, click-to-edit item titles ✅, inline delete confirm ✅, CSV modal opens ✅, camera fullscreen overlay ✅
- FINDING-3 (stale 5%/7% fee copy on organizer settings.tsx) → fixed (committed 9d6bfda)
- CSV import 500 bug: `importItemsFromCSV` called `createMany()` without `embedding: []` → NOT NULL constraint violation. Fixed in `itemController.ts` (committed a670457)
- Root cause: `DEFAULT '{}'` dropped from `embedding Float[]` column in coupon migration `20260307153530`. All new item create paths must supply `embedding: []`.
- Settings.tsx build error (hallucinated `lastName` field from push_files) resolved — correct file pushed via create_or_update_file (committed 9d6bfda)
- add-items full rewrite (session 127 carry-forward): committed c0831bf — camera fullscreen overlay, flash/torch toggle, tab labels, click-to-edit titles, inline delete confirm
- CSV import fix pending Railway redeploy verification (Chrome disconnected before re-test)

**Session 127 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Chrome QA — add-items photo upload flow. 2 bugs found and fixed.
- Bug 1: Manual Entry tab had no photo upload field. Fixed — standard file input added (no AI, preserves AI as paid feature).
- Bug 2: Camera tab Analyze button fired API call but discarded response — toast appeared, nothing happened. Fixed — `uploadCapturedPhoto` now consumes response, pre-fills form, switches to Manual tab. Auto-create (⚡) checkbox added above Start Camera button.
- UX decision: Manual Entry = standard upload only. Camera = AI pre-fill (with option to auto-create immediately).
- Merge conflict resolved (agents had done full-file rewrites across multiple commits). Final file: 989 lines, all auction fields intact.
- Commits: 451b1de, db0e1b8, 4d61bcf, 1f4cada (MCP), 202127c (local), afc280a (conflict resolution).
- FINDING-3 (stale fee copy on dashboard) — deferred from session 126, still open.
- 4 new QA findings queued — all resolved in Session 128: camera fullscreen/flash ✅, tab labels ✅, click-to-edit ✅, CSV import tested + fixed ✅.

Last Updated: 2026-03-11 (session 139 — conversation-defaults v4 skill packaged with Rule 13)
