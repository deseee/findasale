## Active Objective

**Session 257 COMPLETE (2026-03-23) — RATE LIMIT WHITELIST + S256 SMOKE TEST:**
- ✅ Rate limit whitelist implemented — `RATE_LIMIT_WHITELIST_IPS` env var added to `packages/backend/src/index.ts`. All 4 rate limiters (globalLimiter, viewerLimiter, authLimiter, contactLimiter) now skip whitelisted IPs. Commit `ea77e26`.
- ✅ S256 smoke test COMPLETE — All 12 S256 items verified live via Chrome MCP. No P0/P1/P2 issues.
- ⚠️ 2 P3 findings: shopper/dashboard H1 still says "My Dashboard" (should be "Shopper Dashboard"), /profile H1 still says "My Profile" — cosmetic only, no user task blocked
- ⚠️ SD7 (EmptyState nudge) not visually confirmed — user11 has activity so empty state doesn't render. Not a failure.
- 📋 **S258 PRIORITY 1:** Tier 2+ UX batches from `claude_docs/ux-spotchecks/S256-UX-SPECS-41-items-onboarding.md`
- 📋 **S258 PRIORITY 2:** Organizer onboarding flow implementation (spec in S256-UX-SPECS)
- 📋 **S258 PRIORITY 3:** 17 strategic S248 items → advisory board + innovation agents
- 📋 **S258 OPTIONAL P3:** H1 copy fixes — shopper/dashboard "My Dashboard"→"Shopper Dashboard", /profile "My Profile"→consistent label
- Last Updated: 2026-03-23

**Session 256 COMPLETE (2026-03-23) — UX POLISH BATCH + SD4 FIX:**
- ✅ SD4 FIXED — `/api/streaks/profile` now returns `streakPoints`, `visitStreak`, `huntPassActive`, `huntPassExpiry` from User model (was only returning UserStreaks table data). Commit `b7b05c3`.
- ✅ OD1/OD2 — Nav labels updated: "My Dashboard"→"Shopper Dashboard", "My Profile"→"Organizer Profile", "My Dashboard"→"Organizer Dashboard". Commit `6dafd59`.
- ✅ OV3 — Payouts link added to organizer nav dropdown. Commit `6dafd59`.
- ✅ S3 — shopper/settings.tsx double footer fixed (nested Layout wrapper removed). Commit `6dafd59`.
- ✅ H5 — ThemeToggle added to desktop header (was mobile-only). Commit `af48ac2`.
- ✅ SD5 — Hunt Pass info card added to shopper dashboard Overview tab top; Upgrade button tooltip added. Commit `af48ac2`.
- ✅ SD7 — "Browse upcoming sales" EmptyState nudge repositioned after ActivitySummary. Commit `af48ac2`.
- ✅ PR2 — Points/tier explainer text added to profile.tsx under Hunt Pass section. Commit `af48ac2`.
- ✅ CP2 — Help text added for Specialties and Keywords on collector-passport.tsx. Commit `af48ac2`.
- ✅ WH1 — Testing help text (RequestBin, ngrok, Zapier) added inside webhook form. Commit `af48ac2`.
- ✅ OV2 — Duplicate Reputation Score card removed from organizer dashboard. Commit `af48ac2`.
- ✅ ODB1 — POS button promoted to primary action area above the fold on organizer dashboard. Commit `af48ac2`.
- ✅ UX specs created: `claude_docs/ux-spotchecks/S256-UX-SPECS-41-items-onboarding.md` + `S256-UX-HANDOFF.md`
- ⚠️ **Live QA not yet run** — MANDATORY first task S257: smoke test all S256 changes via Chrome MCP (finda.sale)
- ⚠️ **Remaining from S256 spec:** SD1 (tab restructure — complex), LY1-LY10 (gamification — strategic), P4 (17 strategic items → advisory/innovation), remaining Tier 2+ UX batches from S256-UX-SPECS
- Last Updated: 2026-03-23

**Session 255 COMPLETE (2026-03-23) — BUG FIX BATCH + DECISIONS:**
- ✅ `/organizer/profile` → redirect to `/organizer/settings` (profile page retired, D-confirmed)
- ✅ `/organizer/inventory` → "Coming Soon" Persistent Inventory stub (deferred post-beta)
- ✅ `/organizer/premium` → redirect to `/organizer/subscription`
- ✅ Organizer dashboard double modal fixed (single modal on fresh load)

- ✅ All 5 QA checks PASS — verified live via Chrome MCP
- ✅ Persistent Inventory added to roadmap.md deferred section
- ✅ Confirmed: all 29 S248 bugs + 8 dark mode violations resolved
- ⚠️ Remaining S248: SD4 (streak/points data) + P2 (organizer onboarding flow)
- **S256 PRIORITY 1:** 41 UX items from S248 → findasale-ux spec → parallel dev batches
- **S256 PRIORITY 2:** Organizer onboarding flow — findasale-ux spec first, then findasale-dev
- **S256 PRIORITY 3:** SD4 streak/points data fix
- **S256 PRIORITY 4:** 17 strategic S248 items → advisory board / innovation
- Last Updated: 2026-03-23

**Session 253 COMPLETE (2026-03-23) — S252 SMOKE TEST CONTINUATION + 3 BUG FIXES:**
- ✅ **3 dev fixes pushed** (commit 011d18b): `/api/bids` route created (GET, auth, Prisma nested select, computed status active/winning/outbid/closed), `/organizer/upgrade` → `/pricing` redirect (D-012), `authLimiter` max raised 50→100
- ✅ **Rate limiter fix deployed** — confirmed live (Railway/Vercel "A new version is available" banner appeared mid-session)
- ✅ **Item 8 PASS** — /organizer/settings loads with full write controls (7 tabs, editable fields, Save Changes)
- ✅ **Items 10a/b/c PASS** — /shopper/loyalty, /shopper/collector-passport, /shopper/bids each exactly 1 footer
- ✅ **Item 5 re-verify PASS** — /shopper/bids now renders bid data (Tiffany Lamp $320, Ansel Adams Print $280 visible)
- ✅ **S253-P1 /organizer/sales PASS** — 1 footer, page loads correctly
- ✅ **S253-P2 dashboard tabs PASS** — Overview/Sales tab switching works desktop + mobile 375px
- ❌ **Item 7 FAIL** — /organizer/profile 404s (page doesn't exist)
- ❌ **Item 9b FAIL** — /organizer/premium renders own legacy pricing page, does NOT redirect to /organizer/subscription
- ⚠️ **S253-P1 /organizer/inventory BLOCKED** — 404s, can't test footer
- **5 P1 bugs found in QA:**
  1. `/organizer/profile` — 404 (page doesn't exist)
  2. `/organizer/premium` — no redirect to `/organizer/subscription` (legacy page still rendering)
  3. `/shopper/bids` — item photos missing (0 img elements in DOM, alt text only)
  4. Organizer dashboard — double onboarding modals stack simultaneously (every fresh load as user2)
  5. Shopper onboarding modal "Skip" — navigates to `/login` instead of closing modal
- **2 P2 bugs found in QA:**
  6. `/organizer/premium` — feature comparison list text invisible (checkmarks visible, text blank)
  7. `/organizer/inventory` — 404 (page doesn't exist)
- ⚠️ **S254 PRIORITY 1:** Fix `/organizer/premium` → redirect to `/organizer/subscription` (same getServerSideProps pattern as upgrade.tsx, ~10 lines)
- ⚠️ **S254 PRIORITY 2:** Fix bids photos (investigate `photoUrls` in seeded items + verify `/api/bids` response includes populated URLs)
- ⚠️ **S254 PRIORITY 3:** Fix double onboarding modals on organizer dashboard
- ⚠️ **S254 PRIORITY 4:** Fix shopper "Skip" button navigating to `/login`
- ⚠️ **DECISION NEEDED:** `/organizer/profile` 404 — create read-only page, redirect to `/organizer/settings#profile`, or clean up any nav links pointing here?
- ⚠️ **DECISION NEEDED:** `/organizer/inventory` 404 — create page, redirect to `/organizer/sales`, or clean up links?

- ✅ **Double footer root cause found + fixed** — shopper pages had individual Layout wrappers causing duplication with _app.tsx Layout. Fixed: loyalty, collector-passport, alerts, trails, bids (5 files).
- ✅ **TR1/OP1/OS3 confirmed NOT bugs** — TR1 (Create Trail 404) = route works, OP1 (Verification) = correctly routes to settings?tab=verification, OS3 (Workspace URL) = /workspace/[slug] works
