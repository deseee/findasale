## Active Objective

Session 105 Bug Blitz COMPLETE. Session 106 B1 ADR COMPLETE. Session 107 B1 implementation COMPLETE. Session 109 skill packaging COMPLETE. Session 110 P1 bug blitz COMPLETE. Full detail: `claude_docs/COMPLETED_PHASES.md`.

**Session 113 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Fleet audit + governance overhaul.
- 11-subagent management audit. Fleet grade: D+. Root causes confirmed: honor-system rules, no enforcement gates, no token visibility, 6 of 7 Session 108 fixes never implemented.
- CORE.md v2: consolidated 19 rules → 5 (compression logging + read-before-write hard rule added). ~427 → 107 lines.
- 188 stale docs removed from git (archive-for-removal). Repo: 255 → 67 doc files.
- session-scoreboard-template.json added. session-digest scheduled task (8am daily) created.
- Unused plugins disabled by Patrick.

**Session 112 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Security fix + workflow audit + H1 quick win.
- Scrubbed live Neon credentials, workflow audit + 3 CORE.md fixes, H1 "How It Works" card shipped.

**Session 115 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** P0 security + payment fixes shipped. Token tracking research complete.
- Security fixes: OAuth account-takeover removed (no auto-link by email), redirect_uri allowlist added, tokenVersion-based session invalidation on password change
- Payment fixes: chargeback webhook handler (DISPUTED status), webhook idempotency (ProcessedWebhookEvent), negative price guards in itemController, buyer-own-item purchase guard
- Migrations: `20260309000002_add_token_version`, `20260309200001_add_processed_webhook_event` (Patrick must deploy)
- Research: token-tracking-feasibility.md — IMPLEMENT YES (hybrid approach: budget briefing + checkpoints)
- Migration naming fix: corrected two agent-generated migrations with conflicting names

**Session 114 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** D3 + B2 + H1 shipped. Agent fleet (6 workers) completed.
- D3: Map route planning — OSRM backend controller, routes.ts, routeApi.ts, RouteBuilder.tsx, wired into map.tsx
- B2: AI tagging disclosure — items/[id].tsx, organizer/add-items/[saleId].tsx, organizer/settings.tsx updated with approved copy
- H1: Compact mobile header — search bar py-1.5, main content pt-[92px]

**Session 116 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Token tracking + 3 features shipped.
- Token tracking (P1): CORE.md §3 updated with checkpoint format, `operations/token-checkpoint-guide.md` created, conversation-defaults skill v3 packaged
- Feature #4 (Search by Item Type): `categories/index.tsx` created — /categories landing page with category cards sorted by item count. `[category].tsx` already existed (Phase 29).
- Feature #12 (SEO Description Optimization): `cloudAIService.ts` Haiku prompt — titles now format "[Type], [Material], [Maker]"; tags 5–8 terms biased toward material/era/maker keywords
- Feature #9 (Payout Transparency Dashboard): `GET /api/stripe/earnings` + `payouts.tsx` — per-item breakdown: sale price → 10% platform fee → est. Stripe fee → net payout. Summary totals + full item table on payouts page.

**Session 117 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Feature #11 + Vercel build fix + Feature #10 + earningsPDF fix.
- Feature #11 (Organizer Referral Reciprocal): `stripeController.ts` — fee bypass when `referralDiscountExpiry > now` (0% instead of 10%); `routes/organizers.ts` — `GET /organizers/me` exposes `referralDiscountActive` + `referralDiscountExpiry`; `payouts.tsx` — green referral discount banner when active. MCP commit 3243091.
- Vercel build fix: `pages/items/[id].tsx` — renamed `triggerToast` → `showToast` (6 occurrences). MCP commit 949d743.
- Feature #10 (Serendipity Search): `packages/backend/src/routes/search.ts` — `GET /api/search/random`; `packages/frontend/pages/surprise-me.tsx` — /surprise-me page with filters. Commit 5473c14.
- earningsPdfController fee fix: footer updated from "5%/7%" to "Platform fee: 10% flat." Commit bd34de4.
- A3.6 single-item 500: ✅ RESOLVED — no errors in latest Railway deploy (confirmed by Patrick, session 119).
- New migration: `20260312000001_add_organizer_referral_discount` — adds `referralDiscountExpiry DateTime?` to Organizer. Patrick must deploy.

**Session 126 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Docs correction + session 125 fix verification + item list audit.
- Session 125 fixes verified live in Chrome: BUG-1 (PUT fix) ✅, BUG-2 (organizer null crash) ✅, BUG-3 (dropdown case) ✅
- Organizer item list audit: all bulk actions pass (hide, show, set price, checkboxes). Per-item edit + delete pass.
- 3 new findings: FINDING-1 (no filter/sort on list, P2), FINDING-2 (native confirm on delete, P2), FINDING-3 (stale 5%/7% fee copy on dashboard, P2).
- Audit report: `claude_docs/audits/session-126-dashboard-items-audit.md`

**Session 125 COMPLETE (2026-03-10) — FIXES VERIFIED:** Edit-item + photo management flow audit via Chrome MCP. 4 critical bugs found + fixed. Code pushed (b2ac5c7). All fixes confirmed in production (session 126).
- P0: Save Changes broken (api.patch → api.put mismatch in edit-item/[id].tsx). Fixed — verified ✅
- P0: Shopper item detail page crashes on every item (TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name') — organizer null in API response). Fixed with optional chaining + fallback — verified ✅
- P1: Category/Condition dropdowns blank on edit page (case mismatch). Fixed — verified ✅
- P2: No error state when item not found on edit page. Fixed — pushed, untested.
- Photo ops verified in audit: upload, reorder, delete all working correctly.
- ⚠️ Two remaining issues NOT fixed: (1) backend `getItemById` omits `organizer` from Prisma select (should be fixed in backend); (2) edit page uses public endpoint that filters ENDED/DRAFT items (organizer can't edit items on closed sales).
- Files: `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/edit-item/[id].tsx`, `packages/frontend/pages/items/[id].tsx`.
- Commit: b2ac5c7. Audit report: `claude_docs/audits/session-125-edit-item-photo-audit.md`.

**Session 124 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Chrome audit of organizer item listings + single-item edit flow. Identified PATCH/PUT mismatch and organizer null crash — detailed in audit report.

**Session 120 COMPLETE (2026-03-10):** Beta dry run friction blitz. 13/15 items implemented (items 7 + 13 deferred). Vercel build cascade fixed (6 type errors in items/[id].tsx after agent full-file rewrite). QA P2 fixes: z-index, per-field validation. Docs: migration rollback plan, beta organizer email, spring content, dry run friction log.

**Session 119 COMPLETE (2026-03-09):** Records audit sessions 110–118. 4 drift items corrected (earningsPDF fix, Feature #10, roadmap checkmarks, A3.6). Manifest test PASS — first full live session with `.checkpoint-manifest.json`.

**Remaining open:** B3/B7/D1/C1/C2 (deferred/attorney). VAPID keys confirm in prod. Vercel MCP not yet leveraged. Feature #11 Referral Discount requires Neon migration deploy before active in production.

## Beta Launch Target

**Status: GO.** All 8 audit work paths complete (session 84). All 4 critical code fixes shipped (session 85).

**4 critical code fixes — ✅ COMPLETE (session 85):**
- C1: ✅ JWT fallback secret removed, env var validation guard added on startup
- C2: ✅ Password reset rate-limited (5/hr) via express-rate-limit on `/auth/forgot-password`
- C3: ✅ `/api/upload/ai-feedback-stats` protected with `authenticate` + `requireAdmin` middleware
- C4: ✅ Stripe webhook secret rotation plan documented in OPS.md

**Patrick's 5 blocking items:**
1. ~~Confirm 5%/7% fee~~ — ✅ DONE. Locked at 10% flat (Session 106).
2. Set up Stripe business account
3. Google Search Console verification
4. Order business cards (design ready in `claude_docs/brand/`)
5. Start beta organizer outreach (materials archived — rebuild fresh from strategy/roadmap.md)
6. ~~Rotate Neon credentials~~ — ✅ DONE (Session 111).
7. Optional: consult Michigan attorney re estate sale permit (~$300–500)

Full audit reports: archived (git history, sessions 84–85). Beta checklist: archived.

## Known Gotchas (Production)

- **Railway PORT mismatch** — `PORT=5000` locked in Railway Variables. Must match `EXPOSE 5000` in Dockerfile. Do not remove.
- **Neon production DB** — `prisma migrate deploy` must be run manually after any new migration. 66 applied as of 2026-03-09. Run from `packages/database` (NOT `packages/backend`).
- **Dockerfile.production** — ✅ Restored to `--frozen-lockfile` (session 87, commit b82180d). Lockfile is clean.
- **Git push workflow** — Patrick uses `.\push.ps1` (repo root) instead of raw `git push`. Self-heals: index.lock, CRLF phantoms (--ignore-cr-at-eol), fetch+merge (never rebase), doc-file merge conflicts (--theirs auto-resolve). See self-healing entries #36, #51, #52.
- **Dev stack is now native** — Docker no longer used at all. `image-tagger/` deleted by Patrick (session 81). Backend/frontend/postgres run natively on Windows. See `claude_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- **Production migration deploy (Neon):** Claude reads `packages/backend/.env` from the VM, extracts the commented-out Neon URLs, and provides a ready-to-paste command with real credentials in chat output (ephemeral — never committed). Never embed credentials in any committed file. See SECURITY.md §3 and CORE.md §17.3(c).

## Constraints

- Token efficiency required — keep Tier 1 docs lean
- Diff-only updates
- Grand Rapids beta first — scope is not geography-limited; yard sales, auctions, and flea markets are in scope
