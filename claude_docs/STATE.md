## Current Work

**S438 COMPLETE (2026-04-11):** Patrick's 6-issue review session. Fixed tier-aware platform fees in 5 backend files (organizers.ts, payoutController, earningsPdfController, posController 2 locations, stripeController webhook). Rebuilt hubs page as Flea Market Events with TEAMS TierGate. Merged checklist into /plan as first tab with Planning Assistant as second tab. Moved bounties out of PRO Tools in both navs (Layout + AvatarDropdown). Removed appraisal PRO gate on submit, created shopper appraisals page. Consolidated Inventory/Item Library to single nav entry. Fixed bounties.tsx implicit any type. Fixed earningsPdfController businessName select.

**S438 UNRESOLVED — Shopper Bounty 400 Error:**
Backend `MissingListingBounty` model requires `saleId` (tied to a specific sale). The shopper bounties page was built with a "wanted item" concept (itemName, category, maxBudget, radiusMiles) that doesn't match the backend model. Making shoppers browse sales first to post bounties is backwards UX — the whole point is "I want X, organizers come to me." **Needs Architect spec** to evolve the bounty model: make `saleId` optional, add `itemName`/`category`/`maxBudget` fields to `MissingListingBounty`, create a new GET endpoint for browsing community bounties. This is a schema change + migration.

**S438 UNRESOLVED — Inventory 0 Items:**
Carol sees 0 items at /organizer/inventory despite having sales with items. Frontend is wired correctly to `/api/item-library`. Backend endpoint may filter incorrectly or require different query params.

**S438 Files changed:**
- `packages/backend/src/routes/organizers.ts` — tier-aware fee calculation in analytics
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/payoutController.ts` — always use tierRate, removed ?? fallback
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/earningsPdfController.ts` — tier-aware fees + businessName select fix
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/posController.ts` — tier-aware fees (2 locations)
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/stripeController.ts` — tier-aware webhook fee calculation
- `packages/backend/src/routes/appraisals.ts` — removed requireTier('PRO') from POST
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/hubs/index.tsx` — rebuilt as Flea Market Events page
- `packages/frontend/pages/plan.tsx` — two-tab layout (Checklist + Planning Assistant)
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/checklist/index.tsx` — redirect to /plan
- `packages/frontend/components/Layout.tsx` — nav: removed duplicate Item Library, moved bounties out of PRO, added shopper appraisals
- `packages/frontend/components/AvatarDropdown.tsx` — same nav changes
- `packages/frontend/pages/shopper/bounties.tsx` — rebuilt from Coming Soon (has 400 bug, see above)
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/inventory.tsx` — redirect to /organizer/item-library (was other direction)
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/item-library.tsx` — redirect to /organizer/inventory
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/appraisals.tsx` — removed PRO gate on submit
- `packages/frontend/pages/shopper/appraisals.tsx` — NEW: community appraisals page
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/bounties.tsx` — fixed implicit any type on .find()

**S438 Push block (already pushed during session):** Fee fixes, nav changes, hubs rebuild, plan tabs, appraisals, bounties type fix, earningsPdfController businessName fix — all pushed. Shopper bounties page pushed but non-functional (400 on submit).

**S437 COMPLETE (2026-04-11):** Massive organizer tools session — 6 sale-selector bugs fixed, calendar built, bounty redesign Phase 1 shipped (schema + 6 endpoints + wired frontend), 7 organizer pages improved, typology deprecated and deleted.

**S437 What shipped:**

**Batch 1 — Sale Selector Fix + Calendar:**
- Fixed 6 pages where "Choose a Sale" showed empty even with active sales: promote, send-update, photo-ops, print-kit, checklist, line-queue. Root cause: backend returns flat array `res.json(sales)`, frontend expected `{ sales: Sale[] }` wrapper.
- Built full calendar page (`/organizer/calendar`): monthly grid with color-coded sale events, prev/next/today nav, upcoming sales sidebar, team schedules placeholder. TEAMS tier gated.

**Batch 2 — UI Polish:**
- Subscription toast: suppressed Stripe API error toast when tier available from auth context
- OrganizerSaleCard: dark mode text fix
- Photo-ops station form: removed lat/lng inputs, replaced frame URL with XP teaser card
- Bounty redesign spec: `claude_docs/strategy/bounty-redesign-spec.md` (architect + innovation review)

**Batch 3 — Cross-cutting Fixes:**
- Tier-aware platform fees: new `feeCalculator.ts` — 10% SIMPLE, 8% PRO/TEAMS. Applied to payoutController, stripeController, terminalController. Earnings page shows dynamic fee %.
- Checklist: full dark mode pass + updated default items to match FindA.Sale workflow (Rapidfire upload → AI tags → pricing → publish → process → review earnings)
- Nav cleanup: removed Reviews (merged into Reputation S434), Inventory redirects to item-library
- Appraisals: removed outer TierGate (community feed visible to all), PRO gate on submit only
- Email digest: dark mode pass

**Batch 4 — Bounty Redesign Phase 1:**
- Schema: BountySubmission model with status/expiry/XP fields, indexes, relations to User/Item/MissingListingBounty
- Migration: `20260411_bounty_submissions/migration.sql`
- Backend: 6 new endpoints (browseLocalBounties, submitToBounty, getMySubmissions, reviewSubmission, autoMatchItem, purchaseBounty). Auto-match uses word-overlap at 60% confidence. 2x XP economics (shopper pays 50, organizer earns 25).
- Frontend: Complete bounties.tsx rewrite V4 — tabbed UI (Browse Local / Your Requests / Your Submissions), search + mile range, submission modal, status badges. Fixed premature `</div>` layout bug.

**Final — Typology Deprecation:**
- Commented out typology import + route in `backend/src/index.ts`
- Removed "Typology Classifier" from TierComparisonTable.tsx
- 7 files to delete: typology page, hook, badge, controller, service, routes, test

**S437 Files changed:**
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/promote/index.tsx` — sale selector fix
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/send-update/index.tsx` — sale selector fix
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/photo-ops/index.tsx` — sale selector fix
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/print-kit/index.tsx` — sale selector fix

- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/calendar.tsx` — full calendar (replaced Coming Soon)
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/subscription.tsx` — toast fix
- `packages/frontend/components/OrganizerSaleCard.tsx` — dark mode

- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/bounties.tsx` — complete rewrite V4
- `packages/backend/src/utils/feeCalculator.ts` — NEW tier-aware fee utility
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/payoutController.ts` — tier-aware fees
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/stripeController.ts` — tier-aware fees
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/terminalController.ts` — tier-aware fees
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/earnings.tsx` — dynamic fee display
- `packages/frontend/components/SaleChecklist.tsx` — dark mode + workflow defaults
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/checklistController.ts` — updated defaults
- `packages/frontend/components/Layout.tsx` — removed Reviews nav, Inventory→item-library
- `packages/frontend/components/AvatarDropdown.tsx` — same nav cleanup
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/inventory.tsx` — redirect to item-library
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/appraisals.tsx` — TierGate scoped to submit only
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/email-digest-preview.tsx` — dark mode
- `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma` — BountySubmission model + MissingListingBounty fields
- `packages/database/prisma/migrations/20260411_bounty_submissions/migration.sql` — NEW
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/bountyController.ts` — 6 new endpoints

- `packages/backend/src/index.ts` — commented out typology import/route
- `packages/frontend/components/TierComparisonTable.tsx` — removed Typology Classifier
- `claude_docs/strategy/bounty-redesign-spec.md` — NEW

**S437 Files to DELETE (typology deprecation):**
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/typology.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/hooks/useTypology.ts`
- `packages/frontend/components/TypologyBadge.tsx`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/typologyController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/services/typologyService.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/routes/typology.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/__tests__/typologyClassifier.integration.ts`

**S437 Migration required:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\desee\ClaudeProjects\FindaSale\packages\database
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:QvnUGsnsjujFVoeVyORLTusAovQkirAq@maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:13949/railway"
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

**S437 QA needed:**
- Sale selector: promote/send-update/photo-ops/print-kit/checklist/line-queue → should list organizer's active sales (not empty)
- Calendar: `/organizer/calendar` → monthly grid with sales shown on correct dates, nav works
- Bounties: Browse tab → search/mile range → bounty cards load. Submit → modal opens → select sale/item → submit. Submissions tab → pending submissions visible
- Platform fees: PRO organizer earnings page shows "8%", SIMPLE shows "10%"
- Appraisals: non-PRO user can see community feed tab; submit form shows PRO gate
- Checklist: dark mode renders clean, default items match workflow

---

**S436 COMPLETE (2026-04-10):** Three placeholder pages replaced with functional implementations. S433/S434/S435 confirmed pushed by Patrick.

**S436 What shipped:**
1. **earnings.tsx** — Full earnings dashboard: lifetime gross/fees/net summary cards, per-sale breakdown table with sortable revenue data, year selector, PDF export button. Uses `/api/organizers/me/analytics`. 51-line stub → 350-line functional page.
2. **qr-codes.tsx** — QR Scan Analytics (#186): total scans lifetime, active sale scans, per-sale breakdown table sorted by scan count descending, 3-step explainer. Backend updated: `qrScanCount` added to `/api/organizers/me/sales` response. 51-line stub → analytics dashboard.
3. **staff.tsx** — Team management page: TEAMS tier gate + upgrade wall, workspace creation flow for first-time TEAMS users, member list with roles/dates, invite by email with role selector, remove member with confirmation. Uses existing workspace API endpoints.

**S436 Architect audit result:** Double-close cron issue was already resolved in a prior session. Cron audit cleared.

**S436 Files changed:**
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/earnings.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/qr-codes.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/staff.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/typology.tsx` — fixed 202 response handling
- `packages/frontend/pages/plan.tsx` — fixed scroll-to-middle bug
- `packages/backend/src/routes/organizers.ts` — added qrScanCount to /me/sales SELECT
- `packages/backend/src/routes/lines.ts` — added requireTier('SIMPLE') to 6 Line Queue routes
- `packages/frontend/components/BountyModal.tsx` — dark mode
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/bounties.tsx` — cancel button, dark mode, invalidation
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/bountyController.ts` — shopper notification on fulfill
- `packages/frontend/components/Layout.tsx` — "Price Tags"→"QR Analytics", hubs href fixed
- `packages/frontend/components/AvatarDropdown.tsx` — same nav fixes
- `claude_docs/architecture/ADR-014-hubs-flea-market-repurpose.md` — NEW
- `claude_docs/research/flea-market-software-competitive-analysis.md` — NEW
- `claude_docs/decisions-log.md` — S436 Hubs decisions appended
- `claude_docs/strategy/roadmap.md` — #40 and #238 updated

**S436 Verified:**
- S435 all 5 fixes CONFIRMED in code (Layout mobile nav, offline.tsx, AvatarDropdown, auctionJob, auctionAutoCloseCron)
- item-library already functional (no TierGate, real API call) — no changes needed

**S436 Bounties (#197) — SHIPPED:**
Full end-to-end: organizer cancel button (DELETE /api/bounties/:id + React Query invalidation + loading state), dark mode throughout BountyModal + bounties.tsx, shopper notification on fulfillment (type BOUNTY_FULFILLED, "Good news!", link to /items/{itemId}).

**S436 Hubs → Flea Market Events — DECISION LOCKED:**
- Repurposed Sale Hubs as Flea Market Events (ADR-014). SaleHubMembership → VendorBooth.
- 4 locked decisions: TEAMS tier only, all 4 hubTypes (FLEA_MARKET, ANTIQUE_MALL, POPUP_MARKET, FARMERS_MARKET), unlimited booths, organizer-choice payout (flat booth fee / revenue share / hybrid).
- Nav: "Price Tags" → "QR Analytics", /organizer/sale-hubs → /organizer/hubs (removed "(Soon)" + disabled styling)
- Research doc: `claude_docs/research/flea-market-software-competitive-analysis.md` — key finding: no competitor has shopper app; QR auto-settlement is the differentiator
- ADR-014: `claude_docs/architecture/ADR-014-hubs-flea-market-repurpose.md`
- Roadmap: #40 → "Repurposed S436 — Flea Market Events (TEAMS)", #238 → "Folded into #40 S436"

**S436 QA needed:**
- Earnings page: `/organizer/earnings` → verify summary cards show real revenue data, per-sale table renders, PDF export downloads
- QR Analytics: `/organizer/qr-codes` → verify scan totals load, per-sale table shows qrScanCount, empty state works
- Staff page: `/organizer/staff` → TEAMS user: workspace creation → invite member → member appears in list → remove works. Non-TEAMS: upgrade wall shows.

**S435 COMPLETE (2026-04-10):** S434 audit completed, nav parity fixed, Hunt Pass section corrected. All S433/S434 commits are local and ready to push.

**S435 What was audited and fixed:**
1. **S434 audit** — Read all 14 changed files. 5 bugs found and fixed:
   - `Layout.tsx` mobile nav: Typology was still in mobile "Pro Tools" (removed)
   - `offline.tsx`: Stale comment "TierGate handles PRO access check" removed
   - `AvatarDropdown.tsx`: S434 never updated this file — 3 fixes applied (Add Items href → `/organizer/sales`, Command Center → TEAMS section, Typology removed)
   - `auctionJob.ts`: `auctionClosed: true` not set in bid-won path (fixed)
   - `auctionAutoCloseCron.ts`: Circular import `'../index'` → `'../lib/prisma'` (fixed)
2. **S433 cron audit** — 3 cron files confirmed safe: different query predicates, complementary responsibilities, no double-processing
3. **Full nav parity audit** — Systematic comparison of AvatarDropdown.tsx vs Layout.tsx:
   - Organizer: Messages + Inventory missing from AvatarDropdown (added), Flip Report + Appraisals wrongly PRO-gated (ungated), Sale Hubs href wrong `/organizer/hubs` → `/organizer/sale-hubs`
   - Shopper: AvatarDropdown "Explore & Connect" split into 3 proper sections (Explore / Hunt Pass / Connect) matching Layout.tsx
   - Hunt Pass: Lucky Roll moved from Hunt Pass → Explore (it's a free XP mechanic, not HP exclusive) in both desktop + mobile
   - Mobile bugs fixed: mobile Hunt Pass sections were using wrong state vars (`mobileCartOpen` and `mobileDevToolsOpen`) — replaced with `mobileHuntPassOpen` and `mobileDualRoleHuntPassOpen`
   - TS check: zero errors
4. **Original S434 prompt review** — Confirmed what was NOT done by S434: placeholder pages (promote, send-update, photo-ops, qr-codes, print-kit, checklist, earnings, line-queue, calendar, staff), functional issues with item-library and typology, offline sync awareness, bounties game design check, Line Queue gating. These are separate workloads.

**S435 Files changed (uncommitted — include in push):**
- `packages/frontend/components/AvatarDropdown.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/components/Layout.tsx`

**S435 Next session:**
- Push S433 + S434 + S435 commits using `.\push.ps1`
- S433 migration must run first (see below)
- Chrome QA all S434 pages after deploy
- Remaining S434 original prompt work: placeholder pages, functional bugs

**S433 COMPLETE (2026-04-10):** Full auction overhaul — Phase 1 P0 fixes + Phase 2 professional features. ADR-013 written. Migration required for Phase 2.

**S433 Phase 1 (No migration — ships now):**
- `itemController.ts` — Reserve price enforcement in `placeBid` (bids below reserve rejected with clear error + reserve amount in response). Auto-close lazy fetch in `getItemById` (sets `auctionClosed: true` when `auctionEndTime` past). Outbid notifications to displaced WINNING bidder after new bid created.
- `items/[id].tsx` — Reserve-met badge: "✓ Reserve met" (green) / "Reserve: $X.XX (not met)" (amber). Added `auctionReservePrice` and `auctionClosed` to Item interface.
- `BidModal.tsx` — `auctionClosed` prop added. Submit button disables with "Auction Closed" text when true.

**S433 Phase 2 (Migration required — MaxBidByUser table):**
- `schema.prisma` — MaxBidByUser model added with `@@unique([itemId, userId])`. Relations added to Item + User.
- Migration: `packages/database/prisma/migrations/20260410_add_max_bid_by_user/migration.sql` — NEW
- `shared/src/utils/bidIncrement.ts` — eBay-style tiered bid increment function (NEW)
- `itemController.ts` — `placeBid` rewritten for proxy bidding: user submits maxBidAmount, system auto-bids against competing maxes, calculates actual bid via `calculateBidIncrement()`, marks previous WINNING bids as OUTBID. Soft-close: bid in final 5 min → auction extended 5 min → `auctionExtended` socket emitted. `getBids` anonymized: shoppers see "Bidder 1/2/3", organizers see real names. `getItemById` computes `auctionStatus` (ACTIVE/ENDING_SOON/ENDED).
- `BidHistory.tsx` — New component: anonymized bid log with WINNING badge (NEW)
- `items/[id].tsx` — BidHistory wired in, `auctionExtended` socket listener, auction status badge rendered
- `jobs/auctionAutoCloseCron.ts` — 5-min cron: closes expired auctions, notifies winner + organizer (NEW)
- `index.ts` — Cron scheduled at startup

**S433 eBay categories finding:** Already working. EbayCategoryPicker exists in edit-item form. Export/push use `ebayCategoryMap.ts` runtime mapping. No schema fields needed. No additional UI work required.

**S433 ADR:** `claude_docs/architecture/ADR-013-auction-overhaul.md` — NEW

**S433 Files changed:**
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/itemController.ts`
- `packages/frontend/pages/items/[id].tsx`
- `packages/frontend/components/BidModal.tsx`
- `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
- `packages/database/prisma/migrations/20260410_add_max_bid_by_user/migration.sql` — NEW
- `packages/shared/src/utils/bidIncrement.ts` — NEW
- `packages/frontend/components/BidHistory.tsx` — NEW
- `packages/backend/src/jobs/auctionAutoCloseCron.ts` — NEW
- `packages/backend/src/index.ts`
- `claude_docs/architecture/ADR-013-auction-overhaul.md` — NEW

**S433 Migration required (run before pushing):**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\desee\ClaudeProjects\FindaSale\packages\database
$env:DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:QvnUGsnsjujFVoeVyORLTusAovQkirAq@maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:13949/railway"
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

**S433 QA needed:**
- Phase 1: Place bid below reserve → rejected with error + reserve amount shown. Reserve badge renders correctly (amber → green as bids climb). Outbid notification fires to displaced bidder. Auction past deadline → auto-closes on next page load (no bid accepted).
- Phase 2: Set max bid $200 → system places actual bid. Competitor bids up → auto-counter. Bid in last 5 min → countdown extends 5 min + toast. Bid history shows Bidder 1/2/3 (not real names). Status badge: green ACTIVE → orange ENDING SOON → gray ENDED. Cron runs every 5 min (check Railway logs).

**⚠️ Auction cron audit needed (flagged 2026-04-10 friction audit):** Three auction job files now exist: `auctionCloseCron.ts` (deprecated stub S415), `auctionJob.ts` (declared authoritative S415), and `auctionAutoCloseCron.ts` (new from S433). Unclear if both `auctionJob.ts` and `auctionAutoCloseCron.ts` are wired in `index.ts` — could cause double-close on same auction. Dispatch `findasale-architect` to verify before next production deploy.

---

**S432 COMPLETE (2026-04-10):** eBay OAuth bug fixes + Stripe Connect status display + auction listing type display (3 layers).

**S432 Fixes:**
- `organizers.ts` — Added `stripeConnected: !!(organizer as any).stripeConnectId` to `/organizers/me` response.
- `settings.tsx` — Added `stripeConnected` state, set from `/organizers/me`. Payments tab now shows "Stripe Connected ✓" + "Manage Payouts" for connected organizers; unconnected still see "Setup Stripe Connect". eBay OAuth fixed: removed `/api/` double prefix from all 3 eBay calls; changed from axios-following `res.redirect()` to `res.json({ redirectUrl })` + `window.location.href`. Public eBay callback route un-gated from JWT middleware.
- `saleController.ts` — `getSale` now includes `listingType`, `auctionReservePrice`, `auctionClosed` in items select (were missing, causing auction items to render as fixed-price).
- `sales/[id].tsx` — Auction UI conditions updated to check `item.listingType === 'AUCTION'` in addition to `sale.isAuctionSale`. `listingType` added to Item interface.
- `add-items/[saleId].tsx` — Auction fields added (Starting Bid, Reserve Price, Auction End Time) when listing type is AUCTION. End time defaults to 8 PM night before sale start. Auction field name mapping fixed (form `startingBid` → API `auctionStartPrice`, etc.).
- `itemController.ts` — `getItemById` and `getItemsBySaleId` now include `auctionClosed` in select.
- `items/[id].tsx` — `isAuction` now checks `item.listingType === 'AUCTION'` in addition to `item.auctionStartPrice`. Fixes auction item detail page showing fixed-price UI.

**S432 Files changed:**
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/settings.tsx`
- `packages/backend/src/routes/organizers.ts`
- `packages/frontend/pages/sales/[id].tsx`
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/add-items/[saleId].tsx`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/saleController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/itemController.ts`
- `packages/frontend/pages/items/[id].tsx`

**S432 QA needed:**
- eBay OAuth: settings → eBay tab → Connect → eBay sign in → redirects back with success toast, connection status shows
- Stripe: connected organizer → settings Payments tab → shows "Stripe Connected ✓" + Manage Payouts (not Setup button)
- Auction item card: auction item on sale page shows bid UI, not Buy Now/Cart
- Auction item detail: `/items/[id]` for auction item shows bid UI, not fixed-price
- Auction create: add-items form → set listing type AUCTION → auction fields appear, end time defaults to 8 PM night before sale

---

**S431 COMPLETE (2026-04-09):** Treasure Trails map activation mode + 3 trail URL bugs fixed + XP purchase rate bug fixed.

**S431 Fixes:**
- `map.tsx` — `activeTrail` state + dismissal bar (trail name, "View Details →" link, ✕ close). Passes `activeTrail`/`setActiveTrail` props to SaleMap.
- `SaleMap.tsx` — `ActiveTrail` interface + optional props passthrough.
- `SaleMapInner.tsx` — `handleViewTrail(shareToken)`: fetches trail on click, sets `activeTrail`. CircleMarker rendering for stops (amber #F59E0B, radius 12). Fixed double `/api/` prefix bug: `api.get('/trails/${shareToken}')`.
- `trailController.ts` — `getTrail`: shareToken fallback lookup after ID lookup returns null. Fixes "Trail Not Found" on detail page.
- `useTrails.ts` — `usePublicTrail`: was calling `/trails/public/${shareToken}` (nonexistent route) → fixed to `/trails/${shareToken}`.
- `stripeController.ts` — P0 XP bug: `PURCHASE_COMPLETED` was awarding flat 1 XP regardless of amount. Fixed both POS path (`Math.floor(totalAmountCents/100 * XP_AWARDS.PURCHASE)`) and webhook path (`Math.floor(Number(purchase.amount) * XP_AWARDS.PURCHASE)`). Min 1 XP enforced.
- Test trail + 3 stops inserted into Railway DB directly via psycopg2 for testing.

**S431 Files changed:**
- `packages/frontend/pages/map.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/components/SaleMap.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/components/SaleMapInner.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/hooks/useTrails.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/trailController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/stripeController.ts`

**S431 QA needed:**
- Trail activation: open map → click sale with trail → "View Treasure Trail →" button → trail stops appear as amber circles
- Trail dismissal: ✕ button removes stops from map
- Trail detail page: `/trail/[shareToken]` should now load (useTrails.ts fix deployed)
- XP: complete a purchase → check `PointsTransaction` for `Math.floor(amount)` XP, not flat 1

---

**S430 COMPLETE (2026-04-09):** Sale page layout cleanup, email spam fixes, iOS geo UX, organizer photo upload, label redesign, print label auth fix, activity dedup, auction Buy Now gate.

**S430 Fixes:**
- `emailTemplateService.ts` — removed literal `[UNSUBSCRIBE_URL]` placeholder from footer (spam trigger). Replaced with transactional email disclosure.
- `buyingPoolController.ts`, `collectorPassportService.ts` — unified sender from `findasale.com` (unverified) → `finda.sale` (verified in Resend).
- `posController.ts` — subject `"Payment link: $X"` → `"Your checkout is ready — $X"` (phishing trigger removed).
- `next.config.js` — added `api.qrserver.com` to `images.domains` (QR codes were silently blocked by Next.js image loader).
- `map.tsx` — Permissions API query-first pattern + two-phase accuracy + iOS-specific PERMISSION_DENIED messages.
- `index.tsx` — homepage auto-locates only when permission already `'granted'` (prevents iOS Safari false PERMISSION_DENIED).
- `sales/[id].tsx` — Removed broken duplicate LocationMap. Removed standalone HypeMeter card (moved inline above LiveFeedTicker). Removed ActivityFeed at bottom (duplicate). Removed SocialProofBadge ("Sale Activity" pill). Removed second Organized By card; moved "Plan My Route in Maps" button into Location card. Auction Buy Now gate hardened: `!sale.isAuctionSale && !item.auctionStartPrice`.
- `PickupBookingCard.tsx` — full dark mode. Internal post-purchase gate (only shows if user has a hold at sale).
- `sales/[id].tsx` — PickupBookingCard removed from sale page entirely.
- `checkout-success.tsx` — PickupBookingCard added to receipt page with haversine GPS gate: hidden if buyer is within 300m of sale (they're already there).
- `userController.ts` — `getPurchases` now includes `sale.lat`, `sale.lng`, `sale.id`, `sale.address` etc. for GPS check.
- `sales/[id].tsx` — Organizer photo management: "+ Add Photos" button in gallery (max 6), × remove on thumbnail hover, `handlePhotoUpload` (Cloudinary via existing `/upload/sale-photos`), `handleRemovePhoto`, file size validation.
- `edit-item/[id].tsx` — Print Label button fixed: was `window.open(url)` → now `api.get(responseType: 'blob')` + blob URL. Bearer token now sent correctly.
- `labelController.ts` — Label redesign: two-column layout (text left, QR right), QR 72×72 vertically centred, content block centred in label, removed `moveDown(0.5)` that caused blank second page, border 1pt inset from page edge.

**S430 Files changed:**
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/buyingPoolController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/posController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/userController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/labelController.ts`

- `packages/frontend/pages/sales/[id].tsx`
- `packages/frontend/pages/shopper/checkout-success.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/edit-item/[id].tsx`

**S430 QA needed:**
- Email: send a payment link / invite email to Yahoo address → confirm not spam
- QR code on sale page: confirm QR image renders (not broken image)
- iOS map page: test geolocation → two-phase accuracy, correct error message if denied
- Sale page: confirm only 2 live activity elements (HypeMeter pill + LiveFeedTicker card)
- Sale page: auction items → confirm no "Buy Now" button
- Receipt page: organizer pickup slots only shown when buyer not at sale (GPS gate)
- Print label: open from edit-item page → PDF opens with no second blank page, content centred
- Photo upload: organizer adds photo from sale page → appears in gallery, capped at 6

**S429 COMPLETE (2026-04-09):** POS socket 502 fixes, payment intent fee bug, Stripe Connect invalid account, expired hold blocking, IDB crash fix, Request Cart Share feature. No migration required.

**S429 Fixes:**
- `PosPaymentRequestAlert.tsx`, `pos.tsx` — last two sockets still using polling → `transports: ['websocket'], upgrade: false`. Eliminates Railway 502s on those connections.
- `posPaymentController.ts` — `application_fee_amount` was 10% of the **total** on a PaymentIntent for card amount only (split payment). Changed to 10% of card portion. Was likely causing Stripe rejection on split payments.
- `pos.tsx` — surfaces actual Stripe error text (`err.response.data.error`) in errorMessage state so Patrick can diagnose Stripe rejections without reading logs.
- `stripeController.ts` — `createConnectAccount`: when `stripeConnectId` is a fake/seeded value (e.g. `acct_test_user3`), Stripe rejects login link. Was rethrowing. Now: detect invalid account error → clear `stripeConnectId` to null → fall through to create a real account. Settings → Setup Stripe Connect now works.
- `reservationController.ts` — `placeHold`: when item is RESERVED but the active reservation is past `expiresAt`, inline-expire it and allow the new hold. Cron runs every 10 min — users were blocked for up to 10 min after a hold expired.
- `offlineSync.ts` — add `onclose`/`onversionchange` handlers to clear stale `dbInstance` singleton. Add try/catch around `db.transaction()` in `getAllFromStore`. Fixes `InvalidStateError: The database connection is closing`.
- `posController.ts` — `sendPaymentLinkEmail`: new endpoint sends Stripe payment link URL via Resend to `buyerEmail`.
- `posController.ts` — `requestCartShare`: emits `CART_SHARE_REQUEST` socket event to shopper's device + creates in-app notification fallback. Confirmed working by Patrick.
- `pos.tsx` — "📲 Request Cart from Shopper" button in invoice panel. Polls 4s after request for cart.
- `PosPaymentQr.tsx` — mailto link replaced with real Resend email button (loading/sent states).
- `Layout.tsx` — `CART_SHARE_REQUEST` socket listener: if shopper has matching cart → auto-posts POSSession; otherwise shows actionable toast.
- `usePOSPaymentRequest.ts`, `useSaleStatus.ts`, `useLiveFeed.ts` — websocket-only transport (done earlier in S428/S429 context).

**S429 Files changed:**
- `packages/frontend/components/PosPaymentRequestAlert.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/pos.tsx`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/posPaymentController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/stripeController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/reservationController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/posController.ts`
- `packages/backend/src/routes/pos.ts`
- `packages/frontend/components/PosPaymentQr.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/components/Layout.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/hooks/usePOSPaymentRequest.ts`
- `packages/frontend/hooks/useSaleStatus.ts`
- `packages/frontend/hooks/useLiveFeed.ts`
- `packages/frontend/lib/offlineSync.ts`

**S429 QA needed:**
- Socket 502: POS page → no 502 errors in Railway logs on WebSocket connections
- Split payment Send to Phone: $597.96 total, $250 cash, $347.96 card → should create PaymentIntent successfully
- Settings → Payments → Setup Stripe Connect: should redirect to real Stripe onboarding (not 500)
- Expired hold → user can immediately place new hold (no 10-min wait)
- Request Cart Share: organizer taps button → shopper gets notification → cart auto-appears in POS ✅ confirmed

**S428 COMPLETE (2026-04-09):** 4 POS bug fixes — no migration required.

**S428 Fixes:**
- `pos.tsx` — Invoice preview filter: `item.id !== hold.itemId` → `item.itemId !== hold.itemId` (5 occurrences). Root cause: `cartItem.id` is a generated UUID, not the DB item ID. `cartItem.itemId` is the actual Prisma item ID. Same bug fixed in `miscItems` prop to PosInvoiceModal. "📌 On Hold" badge in cart list also fixed.
- `pos.tsx` — `handleLoadHold`: now auto-merges shopper's open linked cart (from `linkedCarts` state) when loading a hold. Adds all shared cart items to POS cart. Toast shows item count.
- `pos.tsx` — Dark mode loaded hold card: `dark:bg-sage-900/20` → `dark:bg-gray-600` (20% opacity was too transparent against parent).
- `posController.ts` — `createPaymentLink` items check: removed `status: 'AVAILABLE'` filter and strict count check. Items may be mid-sale when QR is generated; `amount` is passed explicitly from frontend so the check was blocking QR generation unnecessarily.

**S428 Files changed:**
- `packages/frontend/pages/organizer/pos.tsx`
- `packages/backend/src/controllers/posController.ts`

**S428 QA needed:**
- Invoice preview: Load hold → add misc items → Send Invoice → verify hold item NOT duplicated in preview
- Load Hold: shopper with shared cart → Load Hold → cart should contain hold item + all shared cart items
- Dark mode: load a hold → invoice panel hold card should have dark gray background
- QR code: generate QR for cart with inventory items → 200 (not 400), shopper scans → no AccessDenied

| #143 AI confidence — Camera mode | cloudAIService.ts fix is code-correct; processRapidDraft passes aiConfidence through. Can't test without real camera hardware in Chrome MCP. | Real device camera capture → Review & Publish → confirm "Good (X%)" or similar. | S314 |
| Single-item publish fix | S326 code fix deployed. S327 confirmed API call fires but no DRAFT items exist to test the button. Manual Entry creates AVAILABLE items, skipping draft pipeline. | Camera-capture an item → go to Review & Publish → click Publish on single item → confirm status changes + toast. | S326/S327 |
| ValuationWidget (S406) | No draft items in user2's sales (all 11 are Live). TEAMS tier required. | TEAMS organizer with draft item → Review page → confirm ValuationWidget renders with auth fix + dark mode. | S406 |
| Treasure Trails check-in (S404) | No trail data in DB (test trail inserted S431 via psycopg2). | Organizer creates a trail → shopper navigates to /trails/[id] → checks in at a stop → confirm XP awarded. | S406 |
| Review card redesign (S399) | No draft items for any test organizer. | Camera-capture an item → go to Review page → confirm new card redesign (Ready/Needs Review/Cannot Publish) renders. | S406 |

## Standing Notes

- Railway backend: https://backend-production-153c9.up.railway.app
- Vercel frontend: https://finda.sale
- Test accounts: user1 (TEAMS), user2 (organizer SIMPLE), user3 Carol Williams (TEAMS), user11 Karen Anderson (shopper, Hunt Pass active), user12 Leo Thomas (shopper). All passwords: password123
- eBay: production credentials live in Railway. Browse API confirmed returning real listings.
- POS test: Organizer must have Stripe Connect account configured; shopper must be linked via QR scan first
- DB: Railway PostgreSQL (`maglev.proxy.rlwy.net:13949/railway`) — see CLAUDE.md §6 for migration commands
- Backend route mounts: `app.use('/api/organizers', organizerRoutes)`, `app.use('/api/sales', saleRoutes)`, `app.use('/api/trails', trailRoutes)`, `app.use('/api/boosts', boostsRouter)`, `app.use('/api/lucky-roll', luckyRollRouter)`
- **Stripe Connect webhook (P2 — unresolved since S421):** Configure in Stripe Dashboard → Events on Connected accounts → `payment_intent.succeeded` → URL: `https://backend-production-153c9.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/stripe` → copy secret → Railway env `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Without this, items aren't marked SOLD after POS card payment.
- **STATE.md compacted 2026-04-10:** Sessions S427 and older archived to `COMPLETED_PHASES.md` by daily-friction-audit. ~2,300 lines removed.
