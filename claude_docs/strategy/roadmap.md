## Formatting Rules (Agents Must Read Before Editing)

**STOP. Read this section before making any changes to this file. This is binding on all agents. Violations will be flagged by findasale-records.**

1. **No session-specific notes in this file.** Do not add QA audit results, bug lists, session numbers, or work-session plans to the roadmap. Those belong in:
   - Session-specific findings → `claude_docs/session-log.md` or `claude_docs/audits/`
   - QA results → `claude_docs/health-reports/`
   - Work queues → `claude_docs/STATE.md` or `claude_docs/next-session-prompt.md`
   - Operational tasks → `claude_docs/operations/`

2. **Session numbers must not appear in Notes.** Write "QA confirmed" not "QA re-confirmed S201". Write "P0 race condition fixed" not "P0 FIX S199".

3. **Column format is locked.** Shipped feature tables must use exactly these columns: `# | Feature | Role | Tier | DB | API | UI | QA | Chrome | Nav | Human | Notes`. Do not add or remove columns without Patrick's approval.

4. **Status markers:** ✅ = confirmed working, 📋 = pending/not tested, 📋PEND = pending QA, ⚠️ = issues found, 🔧 = fix in progress, N/A = not human-testable (infrastructure/internal only).

5. **Deferred section:** Keep all deferred items — even rejected ideas may spark good ones. Use format: `Feature | Tier | Reason | Revisit Trigger`.

6. **When adding a new shipped feature:** Add it to the correct section table with all 11 columns filled. Set Chrome/Nav/Human to 📋 unless already verified.

7. **When updating status:** Only change the specific column that changed. Do not rewrite the Notes column or other feature rows.

## Rejected by Board

### Innovation Session — Brand Spreading [REJECT]

| Idea | Role | Tier | Reason |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Shopper Instagram Sticker Sharing | SHO | FREE | Instagram API too restrictive. Revisit Q3 if partnership emerges. |
| White-Label Resale Platform (B2B) | ORG | TEAMS | Too early. Revisit after 10+ paying organizers + $5K+ MRR proven. |
| Marketplace Watermark Variants | ORG | SIMPLE | Too micro-tactical. Merge into Nextdoor export template work. |

### Historical Rejections

| Idea | Role | Tier | Reason |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Pokéstop-Style Sale Markers | SHO | FREE | Gamification mismatch — estate sale shoppers skew older, Pokémon framing alienates core demo. |
| Trader Network | BOTH | TEAMS | P2P trading adds liability, moderation, and trust complexity. Not core to organizer value prop. |
| Egg Hatching Mechanic | SHO | FREE | Too game-y for audience. Confusing metaphor for non-gamers. |
| Team Rivalries | SHO | FREE | Competitive team mechanics don't match collaborative sale-shopping culture. |
| Raid-Style Group Events | SHO | FREE | Complex coordination + real-time features for uncertain demand. |
| Professional Certifications | ORG | TEAMS | Requires industry partnerships, legal review, ongoing administration. Low ROI for beta stage. |
| Mood Boards | SHO | FREE | Nice-to-have but no clear retention or revenue driver. |
| AR Item Overlay | SHO | TEAMS | Hardware/browser support still spotty. High build cost for novelty feature. |

## Design Decisions (Locked — Session 155)

- **Holds expiry:** 48 hours default, configurable per-sale in organizer settings. Nightly cron cleanup.
- **Health score:** Hybrid gate — block publishing below 40% (no photo or title), nudge 40–70%, free above 70%. Progress bar UX, never punitive.
- **Tag vocabulary:** Curated list of 30–50 core tags + 1 free-form custom slot per item. AI suggests from curated list. Quarterly review.
- **Social templates:** Auto-fill v1 with 3 tone options (Casual, Professional, Friendly). Defer WYSIWYG editor to post-beta.
- **Heatmap density:** Radius-based (1–3 mile), pre-computed grid tiles every 6h, 7-day rolling window.
- **Background removal:** On-demand Cloudinary `b_remove` transform only. Primary photo. No batch job.
- **Holds grouping:** By-item in schema, grouped-by-buyer in display. No junction table.
- **Reputation scoring:** Two separate scores — organizer reputation (sale quality, reliability) and shopper reputation (buyer reliability, pickup behavior). Schema must accommodate both; shopper score can be deferred but field must exist from day one. Single-score merge not permitted after schema is locked.
- **Tier lapse state:** Lapsing organizer subscription suspends organizer-only features. Shopper features retained. Full account freeze is not the default behavior. Re-activation on billing resume restores organizer features immediately.
- **Notification defaults:** Both notification channels default to opt-in. Shopper discovery alerts and organizer operational alerts are separate consent items at registration. No "all on" default for either channel.
