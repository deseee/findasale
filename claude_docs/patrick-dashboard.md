# Patrick's Dashboard — Week of April 13, 2026

## What Happened This Week

**S456** (2026-04-14) — eBay inventory import fully operational:
- **86 eBay listings imported with photos** ✅ — Trading API (GetMyeBaySelling) working. Photos from eBay show correctly on `/organizer/inventory`.
- **Sync is now idempotent** — re-sync correctly shows 0 new items (duplicate detection fixed).
- **81 duplicate items cleaned up** from Railway DB directly (from the previous failed sync attempts).
- **eBay photos were blocked by Next.js CSP** — `i.ebayimg.com` added to image domains and `img-src`. Now visible.
- **`sell.fulfillment` scope added** to eBay OAuth — stops the 403 errors in sync cron logs. Artifact MI should disconnect + reconnect eBay once to get updated token.
- **⚠️ "Pull to Sale" not working** for eBay-imported inventory items — confirmed broken, fix is P0 next session.

**S455** (2026-04-13) — eBay inventory import, library→inventory cleanup, OAuth/cart fixes:
- **eBay "Sync Inventory" button live** on Settings → eBay tab. Pulls all eBay listings into `/organizer/inventory` as persistent items. Deduplicates by SKU on re-sync.
- **"Library" terminology fully eliminated:** All code, files, hooks, components renamed to "inventory." `inLibrary` DB field renamed to `inInventory` via migration.
- **Google/Facebook OAuth auto-link:** Accounts created with email+password can now log in with Google or Facebook (same email). Previously rejected with a 400 error.
- **OAuth mobile race condition fixed:** Login with Google/Facebook on mobile no longer gets stuck loading.
- **Cart isolation fixed:** Each user's cart is isolated by user ID. Logging out clears the cart. Previous user's cart no longer bleeds to next user.
- **eBay redirect fixed:** After eBay OAuth, now correctly lands on FindA.Sale settings page (not Railway backend 404).
- **eBay policy scope fixed:** `sell.account` scope added — Artifact MI needs to disconnect + reconnect eBay to get a new token with this scope.
- **Add-items page:** Sale name now shown in header. Walkthrough modal explains Rapidfire vs Regular mode on first visit. All "AI" branding removed from copy.

**⚠️ Artifact MI action required:** Disconnect and reconnect eBay account after deploy (Settings → eBay → Disconnect, then reconnect).

**S453+S454** (2026-04-13) — Hunt Pass → real recurring subscription. Stripe go-live audit.
- **Hunt Pass is now a real Stripe Subscription** ($4.99/mo auto-renewing). Old PaymentIntent flow removed entirely. Users click "Subscribe" → redirected to Stripe Checkout → webhook activates pass. Cancel at period end supported.
- **Subscription ID persistence fixed (P0):** `stripeSubscriptionId` was never being saved → billing portal and cancel always failed. Fixed in `syncTier.ts`.
- **Pricing page endpoint fixed (P0):** `pricing.tsx` was calling the broken checkout endpoint (orphaned Stripe customers). Now correctly calls `/billing/checkout`.
- **POS product catalog guard:** New env var `STRIPE_GENERIC_ITEM_PRODUCT_ID` — when set, all POS payment links reuse one generic product instead of creating new ones per item. Keeps Stripe catalog clean.
- **pricing.tsx null byte build error fixed.**
- **Migration deployed:** `huntPassStripeCustomerId` + `huntPassStripeSubscriptionId` added to User table.

**S452** (2026-04-13) — eBay + Stripe go-live prep. Bidirectional eBay sync (both directions). Policy ID fetch post-OAuth. endEbayListingIfExists wired into all 5 SOLD paths. Phase 3 polling cron (15-min). Stripe env confirmed. **Hunt Pass is a subscription — investigation required next session.**

**S451** (2026-04-13) — Dashboard layout fixed, QR inline, broken buttons fixed:
- **⚠️ Catastrophic push recovered:** Git index desync wiped 1,708 files. Recovery complete via `git add -A`. All files restored.
- **Dashboard layout now correct:** Hero → Action Buttons → QR Panel (inline toggle) → Hunt Pass strip → Tabs → Content
- **Browse Sales removed** (was 404ing). **Button routes fixed:** Collections → `/shopper/wishlist`, Purchase History → `/shopper/history`
- **My QR button** added to action row — QR expands inline below buttons, no more separate card
- **Initiate icon:** sprout → Compass
- **Purchases tab removed** (redundant). Referral banner removed (stale). Saved items banner removed.
- **Pending Patrick decision:** Followed Brands tab — brand tracking for item alerts — keep, rename, or remove?

**S450** (2026-04-13) — Rank staleness P0 fixed, dashboard character sheet attempt, organizer badge, /shopper/ranks:
- **P0 rank staleness FIXED:** `explorerRank` removed from JWT entirely. `AvatarDropdown` now calls `useXpProfile()` API hook for fresh rank on every render. Cascade fixes in `useXpSink`, `haul-posts`, `items/[id]`, `dashboard` (5 files updated).
- **Tier names LOCKED:** Initiate → Scout → Ranger → Sage → Grandmaster (0/500/2000/5000/12000 XP). "Hunter" was wrong — Ranger confirmed.
- **AvatarDropdown XP progress bar:** XP progress bar now shows below rank badge in dropdown using `rankProgress.currentXp / rankProgress.nextRankXp`.
- **Dashboard character sheet attempt:** `RankHeroSection`, `ActionBar`, `RankLevelingHint` built. Dashboard reordered. **BUT QR code landed at position 7 (near bottom) — this is wrong. QR is how shoppers pay at POS. Fix is first job next session.**
- **`/shopper/ranks` page:** All 5 ranks shown with perks + "you are here" indicator. Linked from loyalty page.
- **Organizer Special badge:** `maxOrganizerDiscount` on SaleCard + sale detail page. 4 backend feed endpoints updated.
- **Specs created:** `claude_docs/design/RANK_PERKS_DISPLAY_SPEC.md`, `claude_docs/UX/SHOPPER_DASHBOARD_RETHINK_UX_SPEC.md`

**S449** (2026-04-13) — Full rank perks system + P0/P1/P4 fixes:
- **Rank perks system shipped:** `rankUtils.ts`, hold enforcement (rank-based duration snapshot), wishlist cap (server-side), legendary early access (0/0/2/4/6h by rank), Hall of Fame endpoint + page, RankBenefitsCard + RankUpModal, `getRankDashboardConfig()`
- **3 new migrations:** rankUpHistory, holdDurationMinutes, legendary fields — need Railway deploy
- **Rank staleness P0:** JWT rank sync + AuthContext.updateUser() — nav rank updates live on XP earn
- **Scout Reveal:** interestedUsers returned + results panel on item page
- **Organizer discount badge:** Teal pill on item detail + subtle pill on sale listing cards
- **Haul post test data seeded:** 3 posts for Alice (IDs 2-4) — Bump Post + Haul Unboxing QA-ready
- **Two push blocks** — first (10 files, S449 P0-P4), second (20 files, rank perks system)

**S448** (2026-04-13) — QA audit + Scout Reveal bug + rank naming locked:
- Scout Reveal is a hollow stub — XP spent, toast fires, nothing revealed. Backend never queries interest data. Full flesh-out queued for S449.
- Rank naming locked: **Initiate → Scout → Ranger → Sage → Grandmaster** (prior session dropped Initiate — that was the error; Ranger was always correct)
- "Save Passport" → "Save Profile" copy fix shipped
- Stripe sandbox: COMPLETED ✅
- Bump Post + Haul Unboxing: unverified (no test haul posts in DB)

**S447** (2026-04-13) — 3 dispatch batches, all shipped ✅

**S446** (2026-04-13) — XP frontend + workspace invite flow:
- Hunt Pass cancellation wired to Stripe webhook (exploit gate closed)
- XP earning rates + coupon tiers updated across 6 frontend pages
- 3 micro-sinks: Scout Reveal (5 XP), Haul Unboxing Animation (2 XP), Bump Post (10 XP)
- Organizer-funded discounts: 200/400/500 XP = $2/$4/$5 off; blocks shopper coupon stacking
- Workspace magic link invite: `/join?token=` page, Resend email, MyTeamsCard on dashboards, welcome banner
- WorkspaceMember schema properly fixed: `organizerId` nullable, `userId` added — no ghost organizer accounts for shoppers/new users
- ⚠️ Bump Post feed sorting pending (DB field set, feed sort not yet implemented)

**S445** (2026-04-13) — XP economy redesign + workspace flows:
- 5 P0 fraud gates shipped (appraisal cap, referral gate, HP claw-back, device fingerprinting, chargeback)
- Workspace invite banner, staff delete, owner permissions gate, template fixes

**S444** (2026-04-13) — STAFF→MEMBER rename + workspace permissions fix.

## XP System — Current State

**Coupon tiers (locked D-XP-001):**
- 100 XP → $0.75 off $10+ | 2x/mo standard, 3x/mo Hunt Pass
- 200 XP → $2.00 off $25+ | 2x/mo standard, 3x/mo Hunt Pass
- 500 XP → $5.00 off $50+ | 1x/mo all users

**Micro-sinks (new S446):**
- Scout Reveal: 5 XP → see who flagged interest first on an item
- Haul Unboxing: 2 XP → celebratory animation on haul post share
- Bump Post: 10 XP → bumps haul post to feed top for 24h (feed sort pending)

**Organizer-funded discounts (new S446):**

- Shopper coupon doesn't stack — best single discount wins

---

## What's Next (S457)

**P0 — "Pull to Sale" broken for eBay inventory items.** Patrick confirmed after photos started showing. The "Pull to Sale" button on InventoryItemCard is not working. Investigate and fix first thing next session before any other work.

**P1 — Survivor accounts:** Dev creates `survivor-seed.ts` with Patrick's real organizer account + 1 QA shopper. These survive the database nuke when real users onboard.

**P2 — Live Stripe webhooks:** Register both webhook endpoints in LIVE Stripe Dashboard with correct event sets.

**Carry-forward:**
- QA queue (S436/S430/S431/S427/S433) — still postponed
- Bump Post feed sort (Architect sign-off in place, dev pending)
- RankUpModal — not connected to AuthContext rank-change yet
- Legendary item flag — no organizer UI yet

## Brand Audit (still open)

- Homepage meta/SEO omits flea markets and consignment
- Organizer profile meta says "Estate sales by [name]" regardless of sale type

All dispatch-ready, no decisions needed.
