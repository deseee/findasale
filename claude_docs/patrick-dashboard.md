# Patrick's Dashboard — Week of April 13, 2026

## What Happened This Week

**S448** (2026-04-13) — QA audit + Scout Reveal bug + rank naming locked:
- Scout Reveal is a hollow stub — XP spent, toast fires, nothing revealed. Backend never queries interest data. Full flesh-out queued for S449.
- Rank naming locked: **Initiate → Scout → Ranger → Sage → Grandmaster** (prior session dropped Initiate — that was the error; Ranger was always correct)
- "Save Passport" → "Save Profile" copy fix shipped
- Stripe sandbox: COMPLETED ✅
- Bump Post + Haul Unboxing: unverified (no test haul posts in DB)

**S447** (2026-04-13) — 3 dispatch batches, all shipped ✅

**S446** (2026-04-13) — XP frontend + workspace invite flow:
- Hunt Pass cancellation wired to Stripe webhook (exploit gate closed)
- XP earning rates + coupon tiers updated across 6 frontend pages
- 3 micro-sinks: Scout Reveal (5 XP), Haul Unboxing Animation (2 XP), Bump Post (10 XP)
- Organizer-funded discounts: 200/400/500 XP = $2/$4/$5 off; blocks shopper coupon stacking
- Workspace magic link invite: `/join?token=` page, Resend email, MyTeamsCard on dashboards, welcome banner
- WorkspaceMember schema properly fixed: `organizerId` nullable, `userId` added — no ghost organizer accounts for shoppers/new users
- ⚠️ Bump Post feed sorting pending (DB field set, feed sort not yet implemented)

**S445** (2026-04-13) — XP economy redesign + workspace flows:
- 5 P0 fraud gates shipped (appraisal cap, referral gate, HP claw-back, device fingerprinting, chargeback)
- Workspace invite banner, staff delete, owner permissions gate, template fixes

**S444** (2026-04-13) — STAFF→MEMBER rename + workspace permissions fix.

## Action Items for Patrick

## XP System — Current State

**Coupon tiers (locked D-XP-001):**
- 100 XP → $0.75 off $10+ | 2x/mo standard, 3x/mo Hunt Pass
- 200 XP → $2.00 off $25+ | 2x/mo standard, 3x/mo Hunt Pass
- 500 XP → $5.00 off $50+ | 1x/mo all users

**Micro-sinks (new S446):**
- Scout Reveal: 5 XP → see who flagged interest first on an item
- Haul Unboxing: 2 XP → celebratory animation on haul post share
- Bump Post: 10 XP → bumps haul post to feed top for 24h (feed sort pending)

**Organizer-funded discounts (new S446):**
- Spend 200/400/500 XP in item edit → puts $2/$4/$5 off the item
- Shopper coupon doesn't stack — best single discount wins

## What's Next (S449)

**P0 — Rank staleness fix (UNBLOCKED)**
Naming locked: Initiate → Scout → Ranger → Sage → Grandmaster. Thresholds: 500/2000/5000/12000. Nav shows wrong rank for new users. Fix rank logic + JWT refresh on XP earn.

**P1 — Scout Reveal flesh-out**
Backend returns interested users (who saved/favorited the item). Frontend renders a "Scout Reveal Results" panel. Right now the feature takes 5 XP and shows nothing.

**P2 — Dashboard rethink + perks system (parallel)**
UX agent: dashboard design brief per rank tier. Game Designer: spec what each rank unlocks. Both run in parallel now that naming is locked.

**P3 — Create haul test data → verify Bump Post + Haul Unboxing**

**P4 — Organizer discount badge on public pages**

## Brand Audit (still open)

- SharePromoteModal generates "estate sale" copy for ALL sale types
- Homepage meta/SEO omits flea markets and consignment
- Organizer profile meta says "Estate sales by [name]" regardless of sale type

All dispatch-ready, no decisions needed.
