# Patrick's Dashboard — Week of April 13, 2026

## What Happened This Week

**S451** (2026-04-13) — Dashboard layout fixed, QR inline, broken buttons fixed:
- **⚠️ Catastrophic push recovered:** Git index desync wiped 1,708 files. Recovery complete via `git add -A`. All files restored.
- **Dashboard layout now correct:** Hero → Action Buttons → QR Panel (inline toggle) → Hunt Pass strip → Tabs → Content
- **Browse Sales removed** (was 404ing). **Button routes fixed:** Collections → `/shopper/wishlist`, Purchase History → `/shopper/history`
- **My QR button** added to action row — QR expands inline below buttons, no more separate card
- **Initiate icon:** sprout → Compass
- **Purchases tab removed** (redundant). Referral banner removed (stale). Saved items banner removed.
- **Pending Patrick decision:** Followed Brands tab — brand tracking for item alerts — keep, rename, or remove?

**S450** (2026-04-13) — Rank staleness P0 fixed, dashboard character sheet attempt, organizer badge, /shopper/ranks:
- **P0 rank staleness FIXED:** `explorerRank` removed from JWT entirely. `AvatarDropdown` now calls `useXpProfile()` API hook for fresh rank on every render. Cascade fixes in `useXpSink`, `haul-posts`, `items/[id]`, `dashboard` (5 files updated).
- **Tier names LOCKED:** Initiate → Scout → Ranger → Sage → Grandmaster (0/500/2000/5000/12000 XP). "Hunter" was wrong — Ranger confirmed.
- **AvatarDropdown XP progress bar:** XP progress bar now shows below rank badge in dropdown using `rankProgress.currentXp / rankProgress.nextRankXp`.
- **Dashboard character sheet attempt:** `RankHeroSection`, `ActionBar`, `RankLevelingHint` built. Dashboard reordered. **BUT QR code landed at position 7 (near bottom) — this is wrong. QR is how shoppers pay at POS. Fix is first job next session.**
- **`/shopper/ranks` page:** All 5 ranks shown with perks + "you are here" indicator. Linked from loyalty page.
- **Organizer Special badge:** `maxOrganizerDiscount` on SaleCard + sale detail page. 4 backend feed endpoints updated.
- **Specs created:** `claude_docs/design/RANK_PERKS_DISPLAY_SPEC.md`, `claude_docs/UX/SHOPPER_DASHBOARD_RETHINK_UX_SPEC.md`

**S449** (2026-04-13) — Full rank perks system + P0/P1/P4 fixes:
- **Rank perks system shipped:** `rankUtils.ts`, hold enforcement (rank-based duration snapshot), wishlist cap (server-side), legendary early access (0/0/2/4/6h by rank), Hall of Fame endpoint + page, RankBenefitsCard + RankUpModal, `getRankDashboardConfig()`
- **3 new migrations:** rankUpHistory, holdDurationMinutes, legendary fields — need Railway deploy
- **Rank staleness P0:** JWT rank sync + AuthContext.updateUser() — nav rank updates live on XP earn
- **Scout Reveal:** interestedUsers returned + results panel on item page
- **Organizer discount badge:** Teal pill on item detail + subtle pill on sale listing cards
- **Haul post test data seeded:** 3 posts for Alice (IDs 2-4) — Bump Post + Haul Unboxing QA-ready
- **Two push blocks** — first (10 files, S449 P0-P4), second (20 files, rank perks system)

**S448** (2026-04-13) — QA audit + Scout Reveal bug + rank naming locked:
- Scout Reveal is a hollow stub — XP spent, toast fires, nothing revealed. Backend never queries interest data. Full flesh-out queued for S449.
- Rank naming locked: **Initiate → Scout → Ranger → Sage → Grandmaster** (prior session dropped Initiate — that was the error; Ranger was always correct)
- "Save Passport" → "Save Profile" copy fix shipped
- Stripe sandbox: COMPLETED ✅
- Bump Post + Haul Unboxing: unverified (no test haul posts in DB)

**S447** (2026-04-13) — 3 dispatch batches, all shipped ✅

**S446** (2026-04-13) — XP frontend + workspace invite flow:
- Hunt Pass cancellation wired to Stripe webhook (exploit gate closed)
- XP earning rates + coupon tiers updated across 6 frontend pages
- 3 micro-sinks: Scout Reveal (5 XP), Haul Unboxing Animation (2 XP), Bump Post (10 XP)
- Organizer-funded discounts: 200/400/500 XP = $2/$4/$5 off; blocks shopper coupon stacking
- Workspace magic link invite: `/join?token=` page, Resend email, MyTeamsCard on dashboards, welcome banner
- WorkspaceMember schema properly fixed: `organizerId` nullable, `userId` added — no ghost organizer accounts for shoppers/new users
- ⚠️ Bump Post feed sorting pending (DB field set, feed sort not yet implemented)

**S445** (2026-04-13) — XP economy redesign + workspace flows:
- 5 P0 fraud gates shipped (appraisal cap, referral gate, HP claw-back, device fingerprinting, chargeback)
- Workspace invite banner, staff delete, owner permissions gate, template fixes

**S444** (2026-04-13) — STAFF→MEMBER rename + workspace permissions fix.

## What's Next (S452)

**P1 — eBay integration testing:** Figure out how to test the eBay integration end-to-end. Need a plan for what accounts/sandbox environment to use, what the test flow looks like, and what "working" means.

**P2 — Test account seed strategy:** Patrick wants to create a test account with full permissions on current seed data. Answer: **Yes, it can survive a DB nuke** — add it to the seed script (`packages/database/prisma/seed.ts`) as a permanent fixture with a fixed email/password. When the DB is nuked before go-live, run `prisma migrate deploy && prisma db seed` and it recreates automatically with correct schema. Next session: read the seed script and add Patrick's full-permissions account as a permanent seed user.

**P3 — Pricing review before Stripe goes live:** Full pass over:
- XP/dollar sinks (current state documented in STATE.md XP section)
- All tier pricing (FREE/SIMPLE/PRO/TEAMS)
- Ala carte sales (per-sale charges)
- Extra team member pricing ($20/seat — verify current implementation)
- Hunt Pass ($4.99/mo — verify)
- Any unlocked pricing decisions that need a final sanity check

**Carry-forward:**
- QA queue (S436/S430/S431/S427/S433) — still postponed
- Bump Post feed sort (Architect sign-off in place, dev pending)
- Brand audit copy fixes (3 items, dispatch-ready)
- RankUpModal — not connected to AuthContext rank-change yet
- Legendary item flag — no organizer UI yet
