# Patrick's Dashboard — S546 Complete

## 🔥 S546 — Recovery Session (S545 migrations)

**S545 push failed in 4 ways. All 4 are now fixed, shipped, and live.**

1. **P3018 — AffiliateReferral index collision.** Migration renamed `AffiliateReferral` → `AffiliateReferral_OLD` but PG indexes are global per schema, so they traveled with the old table under their original names, crashing `CREATE INDEX` on the new table. Fix: prepended 6 `ALTER INDEX IF EXISTS ... RENAME TO ..._OLD_*` statements in the migration so new indexes have clean names.
2. **P1012 — missing opposite relation.** `AffiliateReferral.referredUser` had no inverse on User model (old comment wrongly said "implicit"). Added `affiliateReferralsReceived AffiliateReferral[] @relation("AffiliateReferrals_Referred")` to User.
3. **Vercel TS error.** S545 dev agent wrote `user?.explorerRank` in sales/[id].tsx, but AuthContext User type deliberately excludes `explorerRank` (prevents stale JWT cache — there's a comment explaining this on line 14). Swapped both references to `xpProfile?.explorerRank` via `useXpProfile` hook.
4. **JSX structural error.** S545 dev agent put the closing `)}` for the `{!isSaleLocked && (` lock conditional in the wrong place. Fixed.

**Plus Railway cache-bust** on `Dockerfile.production` to force a clean rebuild after 2 failed builds.

**Migration recovery sequence ran clean.** `migrate resolve --rolled-back` → `migrate deploy` → `generate`. Both pending migrations (`consolidate_affiliate_payout_to_referral` + `add_sale_publishedAt`) now marked OK.

**DB verified via psycopg2.** AffiliateReferral has all 12 consolidated columns. AffiliatePayout dropped. Sale.publishedAt + User.affiliateReferralCode both present.

**Chrome smoke test.** Homepage clean. Sale detail page (`/sales/cmnxvyic4001li51qobwidrbl`) renders clean — no `explorerRank` TS error, title + location show correctly. Only console errors are MetaMask browser extension conflicts (not app code).

## ⚠️ Flags carried forward from S545

**Affiliate payout amounts are still PLACEHOLDERS.** `packages/backend/src/config/affiliateConfig.ts` (PRO=$20, TEAMS=$55). Lock before Batch 4 (Stripe webhook wiring). The "flat cash per tier" vs "2% + $50 floor" decision is still unresolved — both paths exist in code.

**Rank early access timezone gotcha.** Organizer TZ not passed to frontend yet; unlock times render in viewer's browser TZ. Batch 2 concern.

## 📤 What You Shipped This Session

You pushed two commits during this session:

1. **Recovery commit** — 4 files (schema.prisma, migration.sql, sales/[id].tsx, Dockerfile.production)
2. **Post-recovery** — nothing pending, all fixes live

Railway build: ✅ green. Vercel build: ✅ green. Migrations: ✅ applied.

## 📤 Wrap Push Block (S546 doc updates)

Just STATE.md + patrick-dashboard.md:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\desee\ClaudeProjects\FindaSale

git add claude_docs/STATE.md
git add claude_docs/patrick-dashboard.md

git commit -m "S546 wrap: STATE + dashboard update (migration recovery complete)"

.\push.ps1
```

## 🎯 Next Session (S547) — What's Queued

1. **Live smoke test of S545 features** (mandatory per CLAUDE.md §10). Test in Chrome:
   - Sale lock for INITIATE shopper → shows 🔒 + Rank-Up CTA
   - Sale unlock for Scout/Ranger/Sage/GM at correct tier hours (1h/2h/4h/6h)
   - SaleLockCard + rank badge copy
   - Affiliate `GET /api/affiliate/me` returns referralCode + referrals (no UI yet, backend-only)
   - S545 mobile organizer dashboard fix
   - S545 Organizer Insights Decimal fix for Alice
2. **Affiliate Batches 2–10** — architect spec at `claude_docs/feature-notes/affiliate-program-spec-S544.md`. Payout amounts still a decision point (can unblock Batch 4).
3. **Chrome QA backlog** — see STATE.md "## Blocked/Unverified Queue" section.
4. **S542 hold price + Remove button** — still needs shopper with active holds.

## What Happened This Session

S544: Strategy + builds. Hunt Pass polish, Golden Trophy avatar frame, 3x coupon slots, schema pre-wires, affiliate program spec.

**Game Design — Grandmaster Hunt Pass Duration (LOCKED)**
Free Hunt Pass now tied to active Grandmaster status. Lapses on Jan 1 reset if user drops to Sage. Re-qualifying restores it. "Forever" is gone. Spec updated.

**Hunt Pass Page ✅**
- Newsletter benefit → "Coming Soon" amber badge (user-written guides platform, post-beta)
- Treasure Hunt Pro restored (150 scans/day cap — confirmed in xpService.ts)
- Page now shows 5 confirmed benefits

**Golden Trophy Avatar Frame ✅ (built)**
- Amber/gold ring on avatar for Hunt Pass subscribers
- Shows in nav + AvatarDropdown header
- Purely frontend — huntPassActive already exists on User, no schema change needed
- New files: HuntPassAvatarBadge.tsx, Avatar.tsx

**3x Monthly Coupon Slots ✅ (built)**
- HP subscribers: 6/6/3 coupon generations per month (vs standard 2/2/1)
- Backend cap logic updated in couponController.ts
- Frontend coupons.tsx shows dynamic limits based on HP status

**Schema Migration ✅ (created, not yet deployed)**
- tasteProfile Json? on User (pre-wire for Agentic AI Scout)
- ApiKey model (pre-wire for API-First Organizer Toolkit)
- Migration file: `1776893245415_add_taste_profile_and_api_keys`
- You need to deploy this after pushing (block below)

**Research Findings**
- Consignment: FULLY BUILT — not a pre-wire. Consignor model, ConsignorPayout, consignorController all exist.
- Persistent Inventory: Schema pre-wired (fields exist) but MasterItemLibrary model missing — not full build yet.
- Estate Planning (executorUserId, estateId): Pre-wired ✅

**Affiliate Program — Spec Complete, Awaiting Your Decisions**
Full Architect spec at claude_docs/feature-notes/affiliate-program-spec-S544.md.
Payout model: flat cash triggered on first successful paid billing only. No cash for free tier (exploit vector — someone could spin up fake free accounts and collect payouts).

Before dev dispatch you need to decide:
- PRO payout amount (Investor ballpark: ~$20, not locked)
- TEAMS payout amount (Investor ballpark: ~$55, not locked)
- Confirm organizer-only scope (no public influencer network yet)
- Fraud thresholds OK? (7-day account age before code gen, 30-day before first payout)

No rush — amounts will be config constants, not hardcoded. Dev can start the non-amount work first.

## 🚨 P0 — /organizer/sales Broken Live

Screenshot confirmed: "Unable to load sales. Please try again." on finda.sale/organizer/sales. First task of S545 — Railway log check + dev dispatch. Do not start other work until this is diagnosed.
